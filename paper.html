                We explore the hypothesis that gravity is not a fundamental force, but an emergent thermodynamic process analogous to information compression. This view posits that spacetime geometry adjusts itself to most efficiently encode the information content of matter and energy. To test this concept, we developed a computational sandbox to evaluate seventeen distinct physical theories, from General Relativity to speculative models based on string theory, quantum mechanics, and philosophy. We introduce a numerically stable loss function based on the accurate prediction of a black hole's event horizon—the ultimate boundary of compressed information. Our results demonstrate that General Relativity and its closest variants represent the most efficient "compression algorithms" within this framework, while other theories exhibit quantifiable information loss. This work provides a novel method for comparing physical theories through an information-theoretic lens and offers a compelling, computable narrative for the idea of an information-based universe.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The nature of gravity remains one of the most profound questions in modern physics. While General Relativity (GR) provides a remarkably accurate geometric description, it does not fully explain gravity's origins or its relationship with quantum mechanics. Recent work in theoretical physics, particularly inspired by the Holographic Principle and black hole thermodynamics, suggests that gravity may be an emergent, thermodynamic phenomenon rooted in the principles of information.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    This paper investigates a compelling analogy: that gravity is a form of information compression, akin to a deep neural network learning a compressed "latent space" representation of high-dimensional data. In this view, the complete quantum state of a system (the "input data") is "compressed" by the laws of physics into a low-dimensional, macroscopic representation: the smooth spacetime geometry we observe.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                    To move this concept from a philosophical analogy to a testable hypothesis, we developed a computational framework. This paper documents the methodology of this framework, its application to seventeen distinct physical theories, and a detailed analysis of the results, which provide a quantitative ranking of these theories based on their "informational efficiency."

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Methodology</h2>
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">2.1 The Computational Sandbox</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    We constructed a simulation in Python to model a static, spherically symmetric system dominated by a central mass (M), equivalent to one solar mass. The core of the sandbox is a `CompressionModel` class that takes a given physical theory—a "compression algorithm"—as input. Each theory is a function that generates a proposed spacetime metric ($g_{tt}$, $g_{rr}$) for a radial grid around the central mass.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">2.2 The Loss Function: From Entropy to Radius</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Our initial approach was to define the information loss as the squared difference between the source information (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy derived from the true mass) and the geometric information capacity (entropy derived from the predicted event horizon area). This method, while conceptually pure, suffered from catastrophic subtraction—the comparison of two enormous, nearly-identical numbers (`~10^54`) resulted in a loss of all numerical precision.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    To create a numerically stable model, we refined the loss function to compare the *cause* rather than the *effect*. The final loss function is the squared difference between the true Schwarzschild Radius ($R_S$) and the predicted event horizon radius ($r_s$) from a given theory:
                </p>
                <p class="text-center text-lg bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-md my-6">
                    <span class="text-blue-600">Loss</span> = ($r_{s, predicted}$ - $R_{S, true}$)²
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                    The event horizon is located by finding the root of the time component of the metric ($g_{tt} = 0$), as this is its fundamental definition. This revised function compares two small, manageable numbers, providing a meaningful and stable score for each theory's accuracy in predicting the location of the information boundary.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    We tested seventeen distinct physical theories, ranging from established solutions of General Relativity to speculative models. The simulation was run on a grid of 50,000 points using 64-bit precision. The results, ranked by their calculated information loss, are presented below.

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Analysis and Discussion</h2>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    The results show a clear hierarchy of performance. The top 7 theories, all rooted in General Relativity, performed exceptionally well, with a near-zero information loss limited only by the simulation's grid resolution. This outcome is expected and serves as a successful validation of our model: it correctly identifies the known correct solutions as the most "informationally efficient."
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    An interesting case is the Newtonian Limit model, which also scored in the top tier. This "false positive" is highly instructive. The model succeeds because its time dilation component ($g_{tt}$) correctly predicts the horizon location, which is the sole criterion of our loss function. However, it is physically incorrect because its spatial curvature component ($g_{rr}$) is flat. This highlights the specificity of our test: the simulation, in its current form, is a validation of the **information boundary** prediction, not of the full spacetime geometry. A more advanced model would need to incorporate spatial curvature into the loss function to correctly penalize such theories.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                    Theories in the middle and lower tiers (e.g., Emergent Hydrodynamics, Quantum Corrected, Higher-Dimensional) deviate more significantly, producing event horizons at different locations or failing to form a stable horizon altogether. This does not invalidate these theories but quantifies their departure from standard GR within our informational framework.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    We have successfully translated the abstract concept of "gravity as information compression" into a computable, testable framework. Our results demonstrate that General Relativity can be interpreted as a maximally efficient algorithm for encoding the information of a static mass into spacetime geometry.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                    This work opens several avenues for future research:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Refining the Loss Function:</strong> Incorporating spatial curvature ($g_{rr}$) to create a more holistic measure of geometric accuracy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expanding Dimensions:</strong> Moving from a 1D radial model to a 2D or 3D simulation to accurately test rotating systems like the Kerr black hole.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simulating Dynamics:</strong> Modeling the process of gravitational collapse over time to observe if systems naturally evolve towards states of minimal information loss.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                    Ultimately, this project serves as a proof of concept that information-theoretic principles, far from being purely philosophical, can provide a powerful and quantitative lens through which to view the fundamental laws of our universe.
