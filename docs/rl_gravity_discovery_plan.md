"# Turning Gravity Theory Discovery into a Reinforcement Learning Problem

## Initial Reasoning Chain

Let's break this down step by step to understand why and how we can formulate gravity theory discovery as an RL problem:

1. **Problem Identification**: We have a framework that generates and tests gravitational theories by simulating orbital trajectories and comparing predictions to known data (e.g., Mercury perihelion, pulsar timing). The goal is to find theories that accurately predict observations while showing unification properties (balanced performance against GR and RN baselines).

2. **Why RL Fits**: Traditional search is brute-force or heuristic-based. RL allows an agent to learn optimal strategies for generating/modifying theories through trial-and-error, receiving rewards for good predictions. This creates a self-improving loop where the agent gets better at proposing promising theories.

3. **Key Insight**: Each \"action\" (theory modification) leads to a \"state\" (current theory + prediction results), with rewards based on validation accuracy. Over episodes, the agent learns to navigate theory space toward high-reward regions (accurate, unifying theories).

4. **Data Sources**: Start with human-derived formulas (e.g., from literature: Schwarzschild, RN, PPN variants). Generate more via AI prompts. Use astronomical datasets for validation (held-out for true testing).

5. **Scalability Consideration**: Simulations are computationally expensive, so use efficient RL (e.g., off-policy methods) and parallelize evaluations.

6. **End Goal**: An RL agent that can autonomously discover novel theories better than random search, potentially finding unification candidates.

Now, let's detail the RL formulation.

## RL Formulation

### 1. Environment Definition
The \"environment\" is our simulation framework that takes a theory (metric tensor function) and runs validations.

- **State Space (S)**: 
  - Current theory representation: Embed the Python code or metric formula as a vector (use CodeBERT or similar for encoding).
  - Past prediction history: Vector of accuracies on previous validation tests (e.g., [0.95, 0.88, 0.92] for Mercury, pulsar, waves).
  - Unification score: Normalized difference between GR and RN losses.
  - Parameter values: Vector of tunable params (e.g., γ in Linear Signal Loss).
  - Dimensionality: High (~512 for embeddings + 10-20 numerical features). Use LSTM to handle variable-length histories.

- **Action Space (A)**:
  - Discrete actions: Choose to modify specific parts (e.g., \"add torsion term\", \"introduce quantum correction\", \"adjust parameter γ\").
  - Continuous actions: Adjust numerical parameters (e.g., Δγ ~ [-0.1, 0.1]).
  - Generation actions: Prompt an LLM to generate a new theory variant based on current state.
  - Hybrid: Use actor-critic where actor proposes code changes, critic evaluates.
  - Size: ~50 discrete + continuous vector for params. Handle with DDPG or SAC for hybrid spaces.

- **Transition Function (P(s'|s,a))**:
  - Deterministic for simulations: Run the modified theory through the framework to get new predictions/losses.
  - Stochastic element: Add noise to simulations for robustness (mimicking quantum effects or numerical errors).
  - Next state s' = updated theory embedding + new prediction vector + updated scores.

- **Reward Function (R(s,a,s'))**:
  - Dense rewards: +accuracy for each prediction test (scaled by difficulty, e.g., pulsar harder than Mercury).
  - Unification bonus: + (1 - |loss_GR - loss_RN|) * 10 if both losses < threshold.
  - Novelty penalty: - if theory too similar to known ones (cosine similarity of embeddings > 0.9).
  - Efficiency: - computational cost (e.g., simulation time).
  - Terminal reward: +100 if theory passes all validations with >95% accuracy and balanced unification.
  - Sparse option: Only reward at episode end based on overall performance.

- **Episode Structure**:
  - Start: Random or seeded theory (e.g., from human formulas).
  - Steps: 10-50 actions (modifications/tests).
  - End: When max steps reached or unification score > threshold.
  - Reset: Sample new starting theory from pool (human + generated).

### 2. Agent Architecture
Use a deep RL agent to learn the policy π(a|s).

- **Model**: PPO or A2C for stable learning in continuous spaces.
  - Actor network: Input state → output action probs/params.
  - Critic: Input state → value estimate.
  - Use CNN/LSTM for processing trajectory data if including raw orbits.

- **Observation Preprocessing**:
  - Embed code with pre-trained model (e.g., HuggingFace's codeparrot).
  - Normalize numerical features [0,1].

- **Exploration**: Epsilon-greedy for discrete, Gaussian noise for continuous.

- **Training Loop**:
  - Collect trajectories: Run episodes, store (s,a,r,s',done).
  - Update: Compute advantages, train actor/critic.
  - Curriculum: Start with easy validations (Mercury), add harder ones (pulsars) as agent improves.

### 3. Implementation Steps

#### Step 3.1: Data Preparation
- Collect ~100 human theories (GR variants, quantum gravity proposals) as starting points.
- Generate 1000+ more via LLM (prompt: \"Modify this theory to improve unification\").
- Validation datasets: 10 held-out astronomical observations (e.g., S2 star orbits, GW150914 waveform).
- Reason: Provides diverse starting points and ground truth for rewards.

#### Step 3.2: Environment Wrapper
- Use Gym interface: class GravityEnv(gym.Env)
  - step(action): Apply modification, run simulation, return s', r, done.
  - reset(): Pick random starting theory.
- Parallelize with vec_env for faster training.
- Reason: Standardizes for RL libraries like Stable Baselines3.

#### Step 3.3: Theory Representation & Modification
- Represent theories as AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) for safe modifications.
- Actions modify AST (e.g., add term to g_tt).
- Use LLM for complex changes (action: \"generate variant\" → call API).
- Reason: Ensures generated theories are valid Python code.

#### Step 3.4: Reward Engineering
- Multi-objective: Use weighted sum or Pareto front for accuracy + unification.
- Shape rewards: + for partial matches (e.g., correct precession rate).
- Negative for instabilities (e.g., if orbit decays unrealistically).
- Reason: Guides agent toward physically sensible theories.

#### Step 3.5: Training Pipeline
- Library: Stable Baselines3 or Ray RLlib.
- Hyperparams: Learning rate 1e-4, 1M timesteps, batch 256.
- Monitoring: Track avg reward, unification scores, diversity.
- Checkpoint best agents based on validation set (separate from training data).
- Reason: Prevents overfitting to specific tests.

#### Step 3.6: Evaluation & Iteration
- After training: Generate 100 theories, manually inspect top 10.
- Test on unseen data (e.g., new GW events).
- If poor, adjust rewards and retrain.
- Reason: Ensures generalization to real unification problems.

### 4. Potential Challenges & Mitigations
- **High Compute**: Use cloud GPUs; approximate simulations for fast iterations.
- **Invalid Theories**: Add syntax checker; penalize crashes with -100 reward.
- **Local Optima**: Use diverse starts + entropy bonus.
- **Interpretability**: Log modifications; visualize theory evolution.

### 5. Expected Outcomes
- Agent learns to propose theories that accurately predict orbits while unifying forces.
- Discovers novel formulas beyond human intuition.
- Creates a \"theory generator\" model deployable for physics research.

This plan transforms theory discovery into a learnable task, leveraging RL's strength in sequential decision-making under uncertainty.

## Integrating Existing Discovery Agent and Mathematical Theories

To make our RL system more robust, we'll draw inspiration from the evolution of AI in games: from AlphaGo (learning from human expertise) to AlphaZero (pure self-play). Similarly, we can hybridize our approach.

### AlphaGo-Style: Leveraging Human Knowledge and Existing Theories
- **Incorporate Proven Theories**: Use a database of ~500 mathematically consistent gravitational theories from literature (e.g., teleparallel gravity, bimetric theories, f(R) modifications). Even if they fail empirical tests, include them as starting states or supervised examples.
  - For failures: Use as negative examples with low rewards to teach the agent what *not* to do (e.g., theories that violate causality get -100).
  - For partial successes: Fine-tune agent to build upon them (e.g., modify Brans-Dicke to improve unification score).
- **Supervised Pre-Training**: Before RL, pre-train the policy network on pairs of (state, action) from successful human/AI-generated theories. State = theory embedding, action = modification that improved score.
- **Reason**: Bootstraps the agent with physics intuition, like AlphaGo learning from master games.

### AlphaZero-Style: Self-Play and Pure Discovery
- **Self-Play Loop**: Agent plays against itself: One instance generates theories, another validates and scores. Use MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) to explore theory modifications.
- **No Human Data**: In pure mode, start from minimal seed (e.g., flat spacetime) and discover everything through self-play.
- **Reason**: Allows discovery of truly novel theories beyond human biases, like AlphaZero inventing new Go strategies.

### Hybrid Approach: Integrating Our Discovery Agent
Our existing AI-assisted discovery loop (using Grok-4 for theory generation) fits perfectly as a \"proposal network\" in the RL system:
- **Agent Integration**:
  - Action Space Extension: Add \"consult discovery agent\" action, which calls the Grok-4 prompt with current state (e.g., \"Given this theory with score X failing on pulsar timing, suggest improvement\").
  - Prompt Engineering: Feed RL state into prompts: \"Previous action led to reward R. Suggest variant to maximize unification.\" 
  - Fine-Tuning: Use RL to learn when to use the discovery agent vs direct modifications.
- **Bootstrap with Existing Runs**: Use logs from previous discoveries (generated codes, scores) as initial replay buffer.
- **Consistency Checker**: Before simulation, verify mathematical consistency (e.g., check if metric is invertible, satisfies energy conditions) using sympy—discard invalid ones with penalty.
- **Reason**: Combines strengths: Discovery agent's creativity with RL's optimization, while using consistent-but-failing theories as learning opportunities (e.g., \"This fails predictions because of Y; avoid Y\").

### Updated Training Pipeline
- Phase 1: AlphaGo-style pre-training on human/consistent theories.
- Phase 2: Hybrid RL with discovery agent integration.
- Phase 3: Pure AlphaZero-style self-play for fine-tuning.
- Evaluation: Compare discovery rate vs baseline (random search or pure LLM).

This hybrid evolves our system from expertise-guided search to autonomous discovery, potentially uncovering unification theories hidden in plain sight."
