# <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theories including Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, teleparallelism via torsion, non-symmetric metrics, and affine connections for geometrizing gravity and electromagnetism, combined with deep learning transformer architectures featuring positional encoding, multi-head self-attention, feed-forward layers, and residual decoder structures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information through positional encoding for radial scale awareness, multi-head self-attention for capturing long-range dependencies, feed-forward networks for non-linear transformations, and residual connections for multi-scale fidelity, incorporating compactification-inspired sigmoid operations, torsional logarithmic terms, non-symmetric oscillatory residuals, and affine-inspired expansions for comprehensive geometric unification without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (pos_enc + self_att + ff_layer + residual)), where pos_enc = torch.sin((rs/r)) + torch.cos((rs/r)**2), self_att = torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.stack([(rs/r), (rs/r)**3, (rs/r)**5], dim=-1), dim=-1) * torch.stack([(rs/r), (rs/r)**3, (rs/r)**5], dim=-1), dim=-1), ff_layer = torch.relu(torch.sum(torch.stack([(rs/r)**2, (rs/r)**4], dim=-1), dim=-1)) / (1 + torch.tanh((rs/r)**3)), residual = (rs/r)**6 / (1 + torch.sigmoid((rs/r)**4)); g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)**5) * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)**2)); g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)**3) * torch.exp(- (rs/r)) * torch.cos(rs/r)); g_tφ = alpha * (rs**2 / r**2) * (1 + torch.softmax(torch.stack([torch.sin(rs / r), torch.cos(2 * rs / r), torch.tanh(3 * rs / r)], dim=-1), dim=-1)[0] + torch.sin((rs / r)**3))</summary>
