class EinsteinUnifiedOscillatoryCorrection1_0(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory drawing from Einstein's unified field pursuits and Kaluza-Klein ideas, introducing a parameterized geometric correction with alpha=1.0 that mimics electromagnetic repulsion via an oscillatory term in the metric, akin to Fourier modes in deep learning architectures for encoding periodic quantum information from compactified extra dimensions. The key metric components are g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 * torch.sin(2 * torch.pi * r / rs)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 * torch.sin(2 * torch.pi * r / rs)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sin(2 * torch.pi * r / rs)**2), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.cos(2 * torch.pi * r / rs), reducing to GR at alpha=0 but adding EM-like effects for alpha>0.</summary>
