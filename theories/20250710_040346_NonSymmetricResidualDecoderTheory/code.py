class NonSymmetricResidualDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric unified field theory for geometrizing electromagnetism and deep learning residual decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information into classical geometry via non-symmetric metric components and residual inverse operations for multi-scale fidelity. It introduces a residual decoder term in g_tt with inverse hyperbolic functions for decompressing information, a non-symmetric inspired correction in g_rr with higher-order residuals, a modified g_φφ with logarithmic decoding expansion mimicking extra dimensions, and a non-diagonal g_tφ with residual-modulated non-symmetric term for geometric encoding of electromagnetic effects without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^3 / (1 + torch.exp(rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 * torch.tanh(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^2)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * (1 + (rs/r)^2)</summary>
