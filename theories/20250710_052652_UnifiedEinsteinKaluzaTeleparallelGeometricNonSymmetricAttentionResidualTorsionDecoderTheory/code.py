class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelGeometricNonSymmetricAttentionResidualTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric attention-residual decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated sigmoid and tanh residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, exponential and logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, sigmoid-weighted logarithmic and exponential polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.01 * (rs/r)**7 * torch.sigmoid(0.1 * torch.tanh(0.2 * torch.exp(-0.3 * (rs/r)**5)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.4 * torch.exp(-0.5 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**4)) + 0.6 * torch.tanh(0.7 * (rs/r)**3)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.8 * (rs/r)**6 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**3) * torch.exp(-0.9 * (rs/r)**2) * torch.sigmoid(1.0 * (rs/r)**4)), g_tφ = 1.1 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(7 * rs / r) * torch.cos(5 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(1.2 * (rs/r)**3).</summary>
