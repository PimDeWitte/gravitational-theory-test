class EinsteinUnifiedKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricGeometricResidualAttentionTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention sigmoid in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, tanh and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid exponential and logarithmic terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.022 * (rs/r)**7 * torch.sigmoid(0.14 * torch.tanh(0.26 * torch.exp(-0.37 * (rs/r)**5)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.48 * torch.tanh(0.59 * torch.exp(-0.61 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**4))) + 0.72 * (rs/r)**6), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.83 * (rs/r)**6 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**4) * torch.exp(-0.94 * (rs/r)**3) * torch.sigmoid(1.06 * (rs/r)**2)), g_tφ = 1.17 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(7 * rs / r) * torch.cos(5 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(1.28 * (rs/r)**4).</summary>
