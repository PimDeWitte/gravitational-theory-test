class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricGeometricResidualAttentionQuantumTorsionFidelityAutoencoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention autoencoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention autoencoder that compresses and decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, quantum-inspired information fidelity terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include autoencoder-like residual-modulated attention tanh in g_tt for encoding/decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects and quantum fidelity, sigmoid and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and exponential polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and quantum unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials with informational fidelity.
