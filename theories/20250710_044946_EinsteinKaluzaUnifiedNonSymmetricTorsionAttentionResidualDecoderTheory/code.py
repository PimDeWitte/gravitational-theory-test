class EinsteinKaluzaUnifiedNonSymmetricTorsionAttentionResidualDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified non-symmetric torsional attention-weighted residuals, geometric unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated tanh residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, sigmoid and exponential residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted exponential and logarithmic terms in g_φφ for compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**4 * torch.tanh(beta * torch.exp(-gamma * (rs/r)**2))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.sigmoid(epsilon * (rs/r)**3) + zeta * torch.exp(-eta * torch.log1p((rs/r)))), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + theta * torch.exp(-iota * (rs/r)) * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2) * torch.sigmoid(kappa * rs/r)), g_tφ = lambda_param * (rs / r) * torch.sin(4 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(mu * (rs/r)**2)</summary>
