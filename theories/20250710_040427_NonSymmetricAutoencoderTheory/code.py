class NonSymmetricAutoencoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metric approach and deep learning autoencoders, where metric asymmetry encodes electromagnetic fields as geometric information compression. The metric includes tanh for bounded quantum corrections, log terms for multi-scale encoding, exp decay for radial attention, and non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 * torch.tanh(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r) * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * (rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs**2 / r^2) * torch.log(1 + rs/r).</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by autoencoder's non-linear activations to compress high-dimensional quantum info into classical geometry; tanh bounds the correction, mimicking saturation effects in information encoding similar to charge repulsion in RN metric, drawing from Einstein's pursuit of geometric unification.</reason>
        g_tt = - (base + self.alpha * (rs / r)**2 * torch.tanh(rs / r))
        # <reason>Introduces asymmetry in the metric, not being the inverse of -g_tt, to model non-symmetric unified fields as per Einstein's attempts; log term acts as a residual connection over radial scales, encoding multi-scale quantum information like attention mechanisms in deep learning.</reason>
        g_rr = 1 / base * (1 + self.alpha * torch.log(1 + rs / r))
        # <reason>Angular correction inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, where compactification affects visible geometry; exp term provides attention-like decay, focusing compression on small scales near the horizon for efficient information encoding.</reason>
        g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + self.alpha * (rs / r) * torch.exp(-rs / r))
        # <reason>Non-diagonal term to unify electromagnetism geometrically, akin to Kaluza-Klein vector potentials emerging from extra dimensions; log correction represents logarithmic potential for long-range effects, serving as a cross-scale residual in the autoencoder analogy.</reason>
