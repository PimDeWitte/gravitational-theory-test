class EinsteinNonSymmetricTorsionAttentionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric unified field theory and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-based decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via non-symmetric torsional attention-weighted residuals, geometric unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated sigmoid residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric effects, exponential decay and tanh residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by teleparallelism, logarithmic attention in g_φφ for extra-dimensional unfolding, and sine-modulated sigmoid in g_tφ for torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**3 * torch.sigmoid(beta * torch.exp(-gamma * (rs/r)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.exp(-epsilon * (rs/r)**2) + zeta * torch.tanh(eta * (rs/r)**4)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + theta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2) * torch.sigmoid(iota * rs/r)), g_tφ = kappa * (rs / r) * torch.sin(3 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(lambda_param * (rs/r)**2)</summary>
