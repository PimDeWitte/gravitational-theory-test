class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelGeometricNonSymmetricResidualAttentionTorsionDecoderTheoryV4(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention sigmoid in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, tanh and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and exponential terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.011 * (rs/r)**8 * torch.sigmoid(0.12 * torch.tanh(0.23 * torch.exp(-0.34 * (rs/r)**6)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.45 * torch.tanh(0.56 * torch.exp(-0.67 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**5))) + 0.78 * (rs/r)**7), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.89 * (rs/r)**7 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**4) * torch.exp(-0.91 * (rs/r)**3) * torch.sigmoid(1.02 * (rs/r)**2)), g_tφ = 1.13 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(8 * rs / r) * torch.cos(6 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(1.24 * (rs/r)**4).</summary>

        # <reason>This modifies g_tt with a higher-order power law term modulated by sigmoid and tanh functions, drawing from deep learning attention and residual layers to encode compressed quantum information, mimicking electromagnetic field effects geometrically as in Einstein's unified theory attempts, with exponential decay for focus on near-horizon scales like in Kaluza-Klein compactification.</reason>
