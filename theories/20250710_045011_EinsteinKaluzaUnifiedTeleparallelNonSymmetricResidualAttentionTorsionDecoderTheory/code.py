class EinsteinKaluzaUnifiedTeleparallelNonSymmetricResidualAttentionTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified teleparallel torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted geometric unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention tanh in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, sigmoid and logarithmic exponential residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted polynomial and sigmoid term in g_φφ for compaction and unfolding, and cosine-modulated tanh sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**5 * torch.tanh(beta * torch.sigmoid(gamma * torch.exp(-delta * (rs/r)**2)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + epsilon * torch.sigmoid(zeta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**3)) + eta * torch.exp(-theta * (rs/r)**4)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + iota * (rs/r)**3 * torch.sigmoid(kappa * torch.tanh(lambda_param * rs/r))), g_tφ = mu * (rs / r) * torch.cos(4 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(2 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(nu * (rs/r))</summary>
