class AffineAttentionUnificationTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's affine unified field theory and teleparallelism, combined with deep learning attention mechanisms for multi-scale information encoding, where spacetime geometry compresses high-dimensional quantum states through affine-inspired connections and attention-weighted residuals. It introduces an attention-like softmax over affine power terms in g_tt for scale-invariant compression, a teleparallel-inspired logarithmic correction in g_rr, a modified g_φφ with residual expansion mimicking extra-dimensional compactification, and a non-diagonal g_tφ with attention-modulated decay for geometric electromagnetism. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^4]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^4]))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r))), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * (rs/r)^2), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * torch.softmax(torch.tensor([torch.exp(-r / rs), (rs/r)]), dim=0)[0]</summary>
