    <summary>EinsteinKKDLSoftplus0_7: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning autoencoders with softplus activation, viewing spacetime as a compressor of high-dimensional quantum information into geometric structures. Introduces a softplus-activated repulsive term delta*(rs/r)^2 * softplus(rs/r) with delta=0.7 to emulate electromagnetic effects via non-linear, positive-definite scale-dependent encoding (softplus as a smooth ReLU-like residual connection for information flow, preventing negative contributions and mimicking repulsive forces). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = delta*(rs/r) * (1 - softplus(rs/r)/ (1 + softplus(rs/r))) for torsion-like interactions inspired by teleparallelism, enabling geometric unification of vector potentials. Reduces to GR at delta=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + delta*(rs/r)^2 * softplus(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta*(rs/r)^2 * softplus(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = delta*(rs/r) * (1 - softplus(rs/r)/ (1 + softplus(rs/r))).</summary>
