class UnifiedEinsteinTeleparallelKaluzaGeometricNonSymmetricResidualAttentionTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention tanh in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, sigmoid and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.013 * (rs/r)**8 * torch.tanh(0.14 * torch.sigmoid(0.25 * torch.exp(-0.36 * (rs/r)**6)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.47 * torch.sigmoid(0.58 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**5)) + 0.69 * torch.exp(-0.71 * (rs/r)**4)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.82 * (rs/r)**7 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**4) * torch.sigmoid(0.93 * (rs/r)**3)), g_tφ = 1.04 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(8 * rs / r) * torch.cos(6 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(1.15 * (rs/r)**4).</summary>

        # <reason>g_tt starts with the Schwarzschild term and adds a high-order tanh-modulated sigmoid exponential residual, mimicking residual connections in deep learning for higher-dimensional information compression, while the exponential decay encodes Kaluza-Klein-like compaction of extra dimensions, and the powers introduce non-symmetric geometric corrections for field unification as per Einstein's pursuits.</reason>

        # <reason>g_rr inverts the modified Schwarzschild term with added sigmoid logarithmic and exponential residuals; the sigmoid acts as an attention gate for multi-scale decoding, logarithmic terms draw from quantum information entropy measures, and exponential decay provides teleparallelism-inspired torsion corrections, unifying gravity with electromagnetic-like effects geometrically.</reason>

        # <reason>g_φφ scales the angular part with a polynomial logarithmic term modulated by sigmoid attention, inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions unfolding angular components, where the log encodes information compression akin to autoencoders, and sigmoid weights radial attention for non-symmetric metric effects.</reason>
