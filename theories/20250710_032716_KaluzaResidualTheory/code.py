# <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein approach and deep learning autoencoders, where extra-dimensional effects are modeled geometrically as residual corrections. The metric includes a quadratic term mimicking electromagnetic charge and a logarithmic residual for multi-scale information encoding: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 * (1 + log(1 + rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r).</summary>

        g_tt = - (base + residual * (1 + log_term))
        # <reason>Modify g_tt with a residual quadratic term to geometrically encode electromagnetic-like effects, drawing from Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, and add log for higher-order quantum corrections as in autoencoder hierarchies.</reason>

        g_rr = 1 / (base + residual)
        # <reason>Ensure g_rr is the inverse of the diagonal potential term for consistency with metric signature and geodesic equations, maintaining GR-like structure while adding unified corrections.</reason>

        g_φφ = r ** 2
        # <reason>Keep g_φφ as standard r^2 for asymptotic flatness, focusing unification efforts on temporal and radial components as in Einstein's pursuits.</reason>

        g_tφ = self.alpha * (rs ** 2 / r)
        # <reason>Introduce a non-diagonal g_tφ term to mimic vector potential from extra dimensions in Kaluza-Klein, providing a geometric basis for electromagnetism without explicit fields, akin to a cross-attention mechanism in DL architectures.</reason>
