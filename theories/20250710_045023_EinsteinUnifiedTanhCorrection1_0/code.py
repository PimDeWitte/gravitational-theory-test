# <summary>A theory drawing from Einstein's unified field pursuits and Kaluza-Klein ideas, introducing a parameterized geometric correction with alpha=1.0 that mimics electromagnetic repulsion via a tanh-activated higher-order term in the metric, akin to gating mechanisms in deep learning architectures for selectively encoding quantum information at certain radial scales. The key metric components are g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.tanh(rs / r) * (rs/r)^2), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.tanh(rs / r) * (rs/r)^2), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.tanh(rs / r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.tanh(r / rs), reducing to GR at alpha=0 but adding EM-like effects for alpha>0.</summary>
