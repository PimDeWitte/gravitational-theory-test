# <summary>EinsteinTeleInspiredLog0_7: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, viewing spacetime as an autoencoder compressing high-dimensional quantum states into geometric structures. Introduces a logarithmic repulsive term gamma*(rs/r) * log(1 + rs/r) with gamma=0.7 to mimic electromagnetic effects via scale-dependent encoding (log as attention over multi-scale information, residual-like correction). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = gamma*(rs/r)^2 * log(1 + r/rs) for torsion-inspired interactions emulating vector potentials. Reduces to GR at gamma=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + gamma*(rs/r) * log(1 + rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + gamma*(rs/r) * log(1 + rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = gamma*(rs/r)^2 * log(1 + r/rs).</summary>
