class KaluzaDiffusionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning diffusion models, modeling gravity as a diffusive process through compact extra dimensions that denoises high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric incorporates exponential diffusion kernels for extra-dimensional noise scheduling, sinusoidal terms for periodic compactification mimicking electromagnetic fields, tanh for bounded diffusive corrections, logarithmic terms for multi-scale entropy regularization, and a non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.cos(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2).</summary>
