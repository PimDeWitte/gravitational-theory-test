class UnifiedEinsteinTeleparallelKaluzaGeometricNonSymmetricAttentionResidualTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric attention-residual decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated tanh and sigmoid residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, exponential and logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, sigmoid-weighted exponential and logarithmic terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and unfolding, and cosine-modulated sine sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.03 * (rs/r)**6 * torch.tanh(0.14 * torch.sigmoid(0.25 * torch.exp(-0.36 * (rs/r)**4)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.47 * torch.exp(-0.58 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**5)) + 0.69 * torch.tanh(0.71 * (rs/r)**3)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.82 * (rs/r)**5 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**3) * torch.exp(-0.93 * (rs/r)**2) * torch.sigmoid(1.04 * (rs/r))), g_tφ = 1.15 * (rs / r) * torch.cos(7 * rs / r) * torch.sin(5 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(1.26 * (rs/r)**3).</summary>
