class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelGeometricNonSymmetricResidualAttentionTorsionDecoderTheoryV3(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention tanh in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, sigmoid and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and exponential polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.008 * (rs/r)**9 * torch.tanh(0.09 * torch.sigmoid(0.18 * torch.exp(-0.27 * (rs/r)**7)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.36 * torch.sigmoid(0.45 * torch.exp(-0.54 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**6))) + 0.63 * (rs/r)**8), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.72 * (rs/r)**8 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**5) * torch.exp(-0.81 * (rs/r)**4) * torch.sigmoid(0.90 * (rs/r)**3)), g_tφ = 0.99 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(9 * rs / r) * torch.cos(7 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(1.08 * (rs/r)**5).</summary>

        # <reason>Drawing from Einstein's pursuit to unify gravity and electromagnetism through geometry, this g_tt incorporates a residual-modulated attention-like tanh activation on an exponential decay term, mimicking information compression from high-dimensional quantum states. The higher power (rs/r)**9 and small coefficient 0.008 encode subtle electromagnetic-like corrections geometrically, akin to Kaluza-Klein's extra-dimensional compaction, reducing decoding loss by saturating field effects at small scales.</reason>
        g_tt = -(1 - rs / r + 0.008 * (rs / r) ** 9 * torch.tanh(0.09 * torch.sigmoid(0.18 * torch.exp(-0.27 * (rs / r) ** 7))))
        # <reason>Inspired by teleparallelism's torsion for encoding fields, g_rr includes sigmoid-activated exponential logarithmic residuals for multi-scale decoding, reflecting non-symmetric metric attempts by Einstein. This structure compresses quantum information across radial scales, with the logarithmic term providing long-range corrections similar to attention over distances, enhancing fidelity to classical GR while geometrically incorporating EM-like effects.</reason>
        g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs / r + 0.36 * torch.sigmoid(0.45 * torch.exp(-0.54 * torch.log1p((rs / r) ** 6))) + 0.63 * (rs / r) ** 8)
        # <reason>Reflecting Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions unfolded via attention-weighted terms, g_φφ adds a logarithmic and exponential polynomial scaling, modulated by sigmoid for radial attention. This acts as a geometric unfolding mechanism, compressing high-dimensional information into angular components, inspired by deep learning decoders to minimize loss against RN metric by encoding charge-like effects purely geometrically.</reason>

        # <reason>To encode electromagnetism via torsion-like non-diagonal terms as in Einstein's teleparallelism, g_tφ uses sine-cosine modulation with sigmoid for asymmetric rotational potentials, mimicking vector potentials from extra dimensions. This non-symmetric element provides a geometric basis for EM fields, with higher frequencies (9 and 7) for finer quantum information decoding, reducing loss through residual connections analogous to DL architectures.</reason>
