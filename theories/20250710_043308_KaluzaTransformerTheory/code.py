# <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning transformer architectures, where compact extra dimensions are modeled as self-attention over radial scales for quantum information encoding. The metric includes sinusoidal positional encodings mimicking electromagnetic fields geometrically, exponential decay for dimensional compactification, and a non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sin(rs/r) * (rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 * torch.cos(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.sin(rs/r).</summary>
