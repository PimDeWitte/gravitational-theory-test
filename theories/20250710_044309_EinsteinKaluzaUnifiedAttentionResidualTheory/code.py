class EinsteinKaluzaUnifiedAttentionResidualTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-residual autoencoder that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via attention-weighted torsional residuals, non-diagonal terms, and geometric unfoldings. Key features include residual attention-modulated sigmoid in g_tt for encoding field saturation, exponential decay and tanh residuals in g_rr for multi-scale decoding, sigmoid-weighted exponential in g_φφ for extra-dimensional attention compaction, and sine-modulated tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**3 * torch.sigmoid(beta * torch.exp(-gamma * (rs/r)**2))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.exp(-epsilon * (rs/r)) + zeta * torch.tanh(eta * (rs/r)**3)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + theta * torch.exp(-iota * (rs/r)) * torch.sigmoid(kappa * rs/r)), g_tφ = lambda_param * (rs / r) * torch.sin(3 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(2 * rs / r)</summary>
