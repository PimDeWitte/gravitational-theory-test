class NonSymmetricFlowTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metric approach and deep learning normalizing flows, modeling gravity as an invertible flow transforming high-dimensional quantum distributions into low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric includes tanh and exp terms for flow-like activations and density scalings, log terms for entropy regularization, sinusoidal terms for periodic transformations, rational expressions for invertibility, and a non-diagonal component for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r) * (1 + torch.log(1 + rs/r))), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sin(rs/r) / (1 + rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.exp(-rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r).</summary>
