    # <summary>EinsteinTeleDLMish0_3: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, conceptualizing spacetime as a deep learning autoencoder compressing high-dimensional quantum information. Introduces a mish-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r)^2 * mish(rs/r) with alpha=0.3 to emulate electromagnetic effects via smooth, non-monotonic scale-dependent geometric encoding (mish as a DL activation function providing better gradient flow for information compression, acting as a residual correction that saturates like attention mechanisms). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * (1 - torch.tanh(torch.log(1 + torch.exp(rs/r)))) for torsion-inspired interactions mimicking vector potentials, enabling geometric unification. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * mish(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * mish(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * (1 - torch.tanh(torch.log(1 + torch.exp(rs/r)))), where mish(x) = x * torch.tanh(torch.log(1 + torch.exp(x))).</summary>

        # <reason>g_tt incorporates the standard GR term (1 - rs/r) with an added repulsive correction inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and DL autoencoders; the mish activation provides a smooth, non-linear encoding of quantum information into geometry, mimicking EM repulsion that is adaptive across radial scales like residual connections in neural networks.</reason>
        g_tt = -(1 - rs / r + repulsive)

        # <reason>g_rr is the inverse of the modified potential in g_tt, maintaining the geometric structure of GR while including the unified repulsive term; this ensures consistency in the metric tensor, drawing from Einstein's non-symmetric metric attempts to geometrize electromagnetism.</reason>
        g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs / r + repulsive)

        # <reason>g_φφ remains r^2 as in standard spherically symmetric metrics, preserving the angular part unchanged to focus unification efforts on radial and temporal components, consistent with Kaluza-Klein compactification where extra dimensions affect potentials but not base geometry.</reason>
        g_φφ = r**2

        # <reason>g_tφ introduces a non-diagonal term for vector potential-like effects, inspired by teleparallelism's torsion and DL attention mechanisms; the form uses a complement to the tanh(softplus) part of mish to gate information flow angularly, enabling geometric emergence of EM-like fields without explicit charges.</reason>
