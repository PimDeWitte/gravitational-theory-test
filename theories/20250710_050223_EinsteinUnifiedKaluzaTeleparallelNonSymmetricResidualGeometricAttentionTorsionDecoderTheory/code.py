class EinsteinUnifiedKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricResidualGeometricAttentionTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a residual-attention geometric decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention sigmoid in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, exponential and tanh logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid polynomial and exponential term in g_φφ for geometric compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**5 * torch.sigmoid(beta * torch.tanh(gamma * torch.exp(-delta * (rs/r)**3)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + epsilon * torch.exp(-zeta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**4)) + eta * torch.tanh(theta * (rs/r)**2)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + iota * (rs/r)**4 * torch.exp(-kappa * (rs/r)**2) * torch.sigmoid(lambda_param * rs/r)), g_tφ = mu * (rs / r) * torch.sin(5 * rs / r) * torch.cos(4 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(nu * (rs/r)**3)</summary>
