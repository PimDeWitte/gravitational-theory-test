class EinsteinKaluzaUnifiedTeleparallelGeometricNonSymmetricAttentionResidualTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric attention-residual decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated sigmoid exponential residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, tanh and logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, sigmoid-weighted exponential polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.04 * (rs/r)**5 * torch.sigmoid(0.12 * torch.exp(-0.23 * (rs/r)**4))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.34 * torch.tanh(0.45 * (rs/r)**3) + 0.56 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**6)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.67 * (rs/r)**4 * torch.exp(-0.78 * (rs/r)**2) * torch.sigmoid(0.89 * (rs/r)**3)), g_tφ = 0.91 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(6 * rs / r) * torch.cos(4 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(1.02 * (rs/r)**2)</summary>
