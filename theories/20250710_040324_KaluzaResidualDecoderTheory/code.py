class KaluzaResidualDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra-dimensional unification of gravity and electromagnetism, combined with deep learning residual decoder architectures, where spacetime geometry acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information into classical structures via residual connections and inverse-like operations for multi-scale fidelity. It introduces a residual decoder term in g_tt using inverse sigmoid-like functions for decompressing compactified dimensions, a Kaluza-Klein-inspired correction in g_rr with higher-order residuals mimicking extra-dimensional effects, a modified g_φφ with exponential expansion for geometric decoding, and a non-diagonal g_tφ with residual-modulated oscillation for encoding electromagnetic-like fields geometrically without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 / (1 + torch.exp(- (rs/r)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^3), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.exp(- (rs/r)^2)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * (1 + torch.sin(rs / r))</summary>

        # <reason>Drawing from Kaluza-Klein, where extra dimensions unify fields, and DL decoders that decompress via residuals; this term adds a residual inverse sigmoid-like correction to g_tt, mimicking decompression of high-dimensional quantum info into gravitational potential, with (rs/r)^2 for dimensional compactification scale and alpha for tuning the unification strength, aiming to encode EM effects geometrically.</reason>

        # <reason>Inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and Kaluza-Klein modifications to curvature; this introduces a higher-order residual term in g_rr to represent torsion-like effects from extra dimensions, acting as a multi-scale correction for stable decoding of spacetime geometry, preventing singularities and enhancing informational fidelity.</reason>

        # <reason>From Kaluza-Klein compactification, where extra dimensions affect angular metrics; this exponential expansion term in g_φφ decodes angular information with a residual growth factor, simulating the emergence of classical orbits from quantum compression, with alpha controlling the decoding intensity.</reason>

        # <reason>Non-symmetric metric inspiration from Einstein's unified theories to encode EM without charges; this g_tφ term uses a residual oscillation (1 + sin) modulated by rs^2 / r^2 for field-like decay, mimicking geometric electromagnetism via residual connections that preserve information across scales.</reason>
