class TeleparallelKaluzaDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism for gravity via torsion and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions for unifying gravity and electromagnetism, combined with deep learning decoder architectures, where spacetime geometry acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information into classical structures through torsion-inspired inverse operations and compactification-like residuals for multi-scale fidelity. It introduces a decoder-like inverse tanh term in g_tt for decompressing torsional information, a Kaluza-Klein-inspired higher-order logarithmic correction in g_rr mimicking extra-dimensional effects, a modified g_φφ with residual sigmoid expansion for geometric decoding, and a non-diagonal g_tφ with attention-modulated oscillation for encoding electromagnetic-like fields geometrically without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 / (1 + torch.tanh(rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^3)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sigmoid(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * torch.softmax(torch.tensor([torch.sin(rs / r), torch.exp(-rs / r)]), dim=0)[0]</summary>
