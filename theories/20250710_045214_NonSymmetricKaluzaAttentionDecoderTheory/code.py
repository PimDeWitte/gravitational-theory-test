class NonSymmetricKaluzaAttentionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric unified field theory for geometrizing electromagnetism and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions for unifying gravity and electromagnetism, combined with deep learning attention decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information using attention mechanisms for multi-scale selective decoding, non-symmetric metric components for electromagnetic encoding, and compactification-inspired residuals for geometric unification without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r)^3, (rs/r)^5]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r)^3, (rs/r)^5]))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(- (rs/r)^2)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^4)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * torch.softmax(torch.tensor([torch.cos(rs / r), torch.exp(-r / rs)]), dim=0)[0]</summary>
