class EinsteinTeleparallelAttentionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and unified field theory pursuits, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention decoders, treating the metric as a decoder that reconstructs classical spacetime by decompressing high-dimensional quantum information, encoding electromagnetism via attention-weighted torsional residuals and geometric unfoldings. Key features include attention-sigmoid residuals in g_tt for decoding field strengths, exponential and tanh residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric decoding, polynomial sigmoid in g_φφ for extra-dimensional attention scaling, and sine-modulated tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**2 * torch.sigmoid(beta * torch.exp(-gamma * rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.exp(-epsilon * (rs/r)**2) + zeta * torch.tanh(eta * rs/r)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + theta * (rs/r) * torch.sigmoid(iota * (rs/r)**2) + kappa * (rs/r)**4), g_tφ = lambda_param * (rs / r) * torch.sin(2 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(rs / r)</summary>
