class AffineFlowTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's affine unified field theory and deep learning normalizing flows, modeling gravity as an affine invertible flow that transforms high-dimensional quantum distributions into low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric includes tanh for invertible activations, exp for density scalings, log for entropy regularization, sin for periodic affine transformations, rational terms for flow invertibility, and a non-diagonal term for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2) * torch.sin(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * (rs/r) / (1 + torch.tanh(rs/r))), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r).</summary>
