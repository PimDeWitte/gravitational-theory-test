class EinsteinKaluzaNonSymmetricUnifiedTorsionResidualAttentionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified non-symmetric torsional residuals, attention-weighted geometric unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated exponential residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with torsional effects, sigmoid and tanh residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, polynomial attention-weighted logarithmic term in g_φφ for compaction and unfolding, and cosine-modulated sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**3 * torch.exp(-beta * torch.tanh(gamma * (rs/r)**2))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.sigmoid(epsilon * (rs/r)**4) + zeta * torch.tanh(eta * torch.log1p((rs/r)))), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + theta * (rs/r)**2 * torch.log1p((rs/r)) * torch.sigmoid(iota * rs/r)), g_tφ = kappa * (rs / r) * torch.cos(4 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(lambda_param * (rs/r)**3)</summary>
