# Default Theories

This directory contains the baseline theories and standard implementations used throughout the project.

## Structure
- **baselines/**: Proven theories (Schwarzschild/GR, Reissner-Nordström) used as baselines for comparison. These are NOT validated - they ARE the validation standards.
- **source/**: Theories to be tested and validated (currently empty - add new theories here)
- **validations/**: Standard observational tests and benchmarks (Pulsar timing, Mercury perihelion, Cassini PPN)
- **papers/**: Related research and documentation
- **results/**: Baseline performance metrics
- **self_discovery/**: AI-generated variations
- **runs/**: Simulation outputs

## Important Note
The baseline theories (Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordström) are established physics. They serve as the ground truth for comparing and validating new theories. They should never be treated as theories needing validation.
