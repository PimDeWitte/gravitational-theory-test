# Default Theories

This directory contains the baseline theories and standard implementations used throughout the project.

## Structure
- **source/**: Core theory implementations (GR, RN, and all test theories)
- **grounding/**: Theoretical foundations and baseline metrics
- **validations/**: Standard observational tests and benchmarks
- **papers/**: Related research and documentation
- **results/**: Baseline performance metrics
- **self_discovery/**: AI-generated variations
- **runs/**: Simulation outputs

These defaults serve as grounding for all other theory explorations.
