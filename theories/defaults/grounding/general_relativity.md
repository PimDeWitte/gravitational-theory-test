# General Relativity (Schwarzschild Metric)

## Overview
The Schwarzschild metric is the exact solution to Einstein's field equations for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged mass. It serves as the fundamental baseline for pure gravitational effects in our framework.

## Mathematical Foundation

The Schwarzschild metric in spherical coordinates (t, r, θ, φ) is:

```
ds² = -(1 - r_s/r)c²dt² + (1 - r_s/r)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)
```

Where:
- `r_s = 2GM/c²` is the Schwarzschild radius
- `M` is the mass of the central object
- `G` is the gravitational constant
- `c` is the speed of light

## Physical Interpretation

1. **Time dilation**: The factor `(1 - r_s/r)` in g_tt describes gravitational time dilation
2. **Spatial curvature**: The factor `(1 - r_s/r)⁻¹` in g_rr represents radial space stretching
3. **Event horizon**: At r = r_s, the metric becomes singular (coordinate singularity)

## Role as Baseline

In the compression hypothesis framework:
- Represents "lossless" encoding of pure gravitational information
- All other theories are compared against this baseline
- Zero loss against Schwarzschild indicates perfect reproduction of GR dynamics

## Key Properties

- **Exact solution**: Not an approximation
- **Vacuum solution**: No matter or energy outside the central mass
- **Static**: Time-independent
- **Spherically symmetric**: Same in all angular directions
- **Asymptotically flat**: Approaches Minkowski spacetime as r → ∞

## Observational Validation

The Schwarzschild metric has been validated by:
- Mercury perihelion precession (43 arcsec/century)
- Gravitational redshift experiments
- Shapiro time delay
- Binary pulsar observations
- LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave detections
