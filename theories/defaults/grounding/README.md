- **general_relativity.md**: Derivation and principles of Einstein's General Relativity
- **reissner_nordstrom.md**: Charged black hole solution and electromagnetic coupling
- **baseline_metrics.md**: Why these serve as ground truth for the framework

These theories are included as grounding in all other theory explorations, serving as the fundamental baselines against which all candidates are compared.
