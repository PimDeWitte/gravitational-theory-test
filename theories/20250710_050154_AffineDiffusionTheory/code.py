# <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's affine unified field theory and deep learning diffusion models, treating gravity as a diffusive process that denoises high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric incorporates exponential diffusion kernels for noise scheduling, hyperbolic tangent for bounded field corrections, sinusoidal terms for periodic extra-dimensional compactification, and a non-diagonal component for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-(rs/r)) * torch.tanh(rs/r) * (1 + torch.sin(rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.cos(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.exp(-rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r).</summary>

        # <reason>Non-diagonal g_tφ introduces frame-dragging like effects for EM unification, with exponential decay for compactification and tanh for bounded diffusion, reasoning that affine connections encode EM as geometric torsion diffused into spacetime.</reason>
