# <summary>EinsteinUnifiedAlpha0_5: A parameterized unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metric attempts and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions. Introduces a geometric repulsive term alpha*(rs/r)^2 with alpha=0.5 to mimic electromagnetic effects in g_tt and g_rr, and a non-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*rs/r for vector potential-like interactions. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r).</summary>

        alpha = 0.5
        rs = 2 * G_param * M_param / (C_param ** 2)
        # <reason>Compute Schwarzschild radius rs as the fundamental geometric scale, inspired by GR's encoding of mass information into curvature; this serves as the 'bottleneck' in the autoencoder-like compression of quantum information into classical geometry.</reason>

        correction = alpha * (rs / r) ** 2
        # <reason>Add higher-order correction term alpha*(rs/r)^2, drawing from Einstein's unified field efforts to geometrize electromagnetism; this mimics the repulsive Q^2/r^2 term in Reissner-Nordström without explicit charge, viewing it as a residual connection in a deep learning architecture that adjusts gravitational attraction over radial scales, encoding 'EM-like' information purely geometrically.</reason>

        potential = 1 - rs / r + correction
        # <reason>Construct the metric potential by modifying the standard GR term (1 - rs/r) with the correction, analogous to how Einstein explored parameterized deviations in geometry to unify fields; this represents a compression function where higher-dimensional effects are projected into 4D spacetime.</reason>

        g_tt = -potential
        # <reason>Set g_tt to -potential, preserving the time-like component's role in gravitational redshift while incorporating the unified correction; inspired by autoencoder decoders where the output reconstructs classical reality with minimal loss.</reason>

        g_rr = 1 / potential
        # <reason>Set g_rr as inverse of potential for consistency with isotropic form, ensuring the metric remains invertible; this mirrors Einstein's teleparallelism ideas where torsion or non-symmetry introduces field-like effects, here encoded as a modified radial stretch.</reason>

        g_φφ = r ** 2
        # <reason>Retain standard g_φφ = r^2 to preserve angular geometry at large scales, focusing modifications on radial and cross terms; this acts as an invariant subspace in the information encoding process, benchmarked against GR's lossless decoding.</reason>

        g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r)
        # <reason>Introduce non-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*rs/r, inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions where off-diagonal components emerge as electromagnetic potentials; this adds a field-like interaction akin to attention mechanisms over temporal-angular coordinates, hypothesizing a geometric origin for magnetism in orbital dynamics tests.</reason>
