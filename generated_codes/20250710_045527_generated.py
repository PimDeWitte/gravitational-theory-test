class UnifiedEinsteinTeleparallelKaluzaNonSymmetricResidualAttentionTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted geometric unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated sigmoid residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, tanh and exponential residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, sigmoid-weighted logarithmic term in g_φφ for extra-dimensional compaction and unfolding, and cosine-modulated sine tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**4 * torch.sigmoid(beta * torch.exp(-gamma * (rs/r)**2))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.tanh(epsilon * (rs/r)**3) + zeta * torch.exp(-eta * torch.log1p((rs/r)))), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + theta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**3) * torch.sigmoid(iota * (rs/r)**2)), g_tφ = kappa * (rs / r) * torch.cos(3 * rs / r) * torch.sin(2 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(lambda_param * rs / r)</summary>
