class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricGeometricResidualAttentionQuantumTorsionFidelityDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, quantum-inspired fidelity terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention tanh in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects and quantum fidelity, sigmoid and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and quantum unfolding, and cosine-modulated sine sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials with fidelity. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.007 * (rs/r)**11 * torch.tanh(0.08 * torch.sigmoid(0.16 * torch.exp(-0.24 * (rs/r)**9)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.32 * torch.sigmoid(0.40 * torch.exp(-0.48 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**8))) + 0.56 * torch.tanh(0.64 * (rs/r)**10)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.72 * (rs/r)**10 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**7) * torch.sigmoid(0.80 * (rs/r)**6)), g_tφ = 0.88 * (rs / r) * torch.cos(11 * rs / r) * torch.sin(9 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(0.96 * (rs/r)**8).</summary>
