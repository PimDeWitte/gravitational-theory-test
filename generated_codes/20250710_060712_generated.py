# <summary>EinsteinTeleDLsinh0_5: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, conceptualizing spacetime as a deep learning autoencoder compressing high-dimensional quantum information into geometric structures. Introduces a sinh-activated repulsive term epsilon*(rs/r)^2 * sinh(rs/r) with epsilon=0.5 to emulate electromagnetic effects via hyperbolic, scale-dependent encoding (sinh as an odd activation function for residual connections, amplifying at large rs/r to mimic repulsive forces while allowing anti-symmetric torsion effects). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = epsilon*(rs/r) * cosh(rs/r) for torsion-inspired interactions mimicking vector potentials, enabling geometric unification with attention-like weighting over angular scales. Reduces to GR at epsilon=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + epsilon*(rs/r)^2 * sinh(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + epsilon*(rs/r)^2 * sinh(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = epsilon*(rs/r) * cosh(rs/r).</summary>
