class EinsteinDLInspiredCosh0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>EinsteinDLInspiredCosh0_5: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning autoencoders, conceptualizing spacetime as a compressor of high-dimensional quantum information. Introduces a cosh-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r)^2 * (cosh(rs/r) - 1) with alpha=0.5 to emulate electromagnetic effects via hyperbolic, scale-dependent geometric encoding (cosh as an exponential activation function for residual corrections, enabling efficient multi-scale information compression similar to hyperbolic neural networks). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * sinh(rs/r) for torsion-like interactions inspired by teleparallelism, mimicking vector potentials for geometric unification. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * (cosh(rs/r) - 1)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * (cosh(rs/r) - 1)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * sinh(rs/r).</summary>
