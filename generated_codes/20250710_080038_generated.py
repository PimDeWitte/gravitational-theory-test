class EinsteinUnifiedSinhCorrection1_0(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory drawing from Einstein's unified field pursuits and Kaluza-Klein ideas, introducing a parameterized geometric correction with alpha=1.0 that mimics electromagnetic repulsion via a sinh-activated higher-order term in the metric, akin to hyperbolic functions in deep learning architectures for encoding quantum information with asymmetric exponential behavior across radial scales. The key metric components are g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sinh(rs / r) * (rs/r)^2), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sinh(rs / r) * (rs/r)^2), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sinh(rs / r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.cosh(r / rs), reducing to GR at alpha=0 but adding EM-like effects for alpha>0.</summary>

        # <reason>g_tt includes the standard GR term -(1 - rs/r) for gravitational attraction, plus a positive alpha * sinh(rs / r) * (rs/r)^2 term to mimic EM repulsion geometrically, inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metrics and Kaluza-Klein's extra-dimensional fields; the sinh activation provides hyperbolic growth, similar to DL gates for selective information flow, encoding quantum repulsion that decays slower than 1/r^2 for large r.</reason>

        # <reason>g_φφ is r^2 multiplied by (1 + alpha * sinh(rs / r)) to introduce angular distortion, inspired by teleparallelism's torsion and DL's attention over scales, encoding extra-dimensional 'twist' into observable geometry.</reason>

        # <reason>g_tφ introduces off-diagonal coupling with alpha * (rs / r) * cosh(r / rs), mimicking magnetic fields via geometric asymmetry, drawing from Einstein's unified field attempts and DL residual connections for cross-term information transfer; cosh provides bounded oscillation, preventing divergences.</reason>
