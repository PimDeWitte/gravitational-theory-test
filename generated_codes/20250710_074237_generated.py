class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricHierarchicalResidualAttentionQuantumGeometricTorsionFidelityAutoencoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning hierarchical residual and attention autoencoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric hierarchical residual-attention autoencoder that compresses and decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric hierarchical attention-weighted unfoldings, quantum-inspired information fidelity terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include hierarchical residual-modulated attention in g_tt for encoding/decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional and quantum effects, multi-scale sigmoid and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted multi-order polynomial and logarithmic exponential terms in g_φφ for compaction and quantum unfolding, and sine-cosine modulated tanh sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric potentials with fidelity.
