class EinsteinTeleDLHardtanh0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>EinsteinTeleDLHardtanh0_5: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, conceptualizing spacetime as a deep learning autoencoder compressing high-dimensional quantum information. Introduces a hardtanh-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r)^2 * hardtanh(rs/r) with alpha=0.5 to emulate electromagnetic effects via non-linear, clipped scale-dependent geometric encoding (hardtanh as a DL activation function providing bounded activation for stable information compression, acting as a residual correction that prevents extreme values in encoding). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * (1 - hardtanh(rs/r)) for torsion-inspired interactions mimicking vector potentials, enabling geometric unification. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * hardtanh(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * hardtanh(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * (1 - hardtanh(rs/r)).</summary>
