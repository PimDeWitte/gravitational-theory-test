class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricGeometricResidualAttentionTorsionInformationDecoderTheoryV8(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, information compression terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention tanh in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects and information encoding, sigmoid and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and exponential polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and information unfolding, and cosine-modulated sine tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials with informational fidelity.
