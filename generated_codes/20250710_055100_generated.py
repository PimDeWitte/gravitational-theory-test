class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelGeometricNonSymmetricResidualAttentionTorsionInformationDecoderTheoryV2(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, information compression terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention tanh in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects and information encoding, sigmoid and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and exponential polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and information unfolding, and cosine-modulated sine sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials with informational fidelity. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.003 * (rs/r)**12 * torch.tanh(0.04 * torch.sigmoid(0.08 * torch.exp(-0.12 * (rs/r)**10)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.16 * torch.sigmoid(0.20 * torch.exp(-0.24 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**9))) + 0.28 * torch.tanh(0.32 * (rs/r)**11)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.36 * (rs/r)**11 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**8) * torch.exp(-0.40 * (rs/r)**7) * torch.sigmoid(0.44 * (rs/r)**6)), g_tφ = 0.48 * (rs / r) * torch.cos(12 * rs / r) * torch.sin(10 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(0.52 * (rs/r)**8).</summary>

        # <reason>The g_tt component starts with the Schwarzschild term and adds a small, high-order residual correction with nested tanh and sigmoid functions to model information compression from higher dimensions, inspired by deep learning autoencoders and Einstein's attempts to geometrize electromagnetism via non-symmetric metrics; the high power (rs/r)**12 ensures the perturbation is negligible at large r, while the exponential decay and activations mimic attention over radial scales for encoding field-like effects without explicit charge.</reason>

        # <reason>The g_rr component inverts a modified denominator with sigmoid-activated exponential and tanh terms, drawing from teleparallelism to incorporate torsion-like effects and residual connections for multi-scale decoding of quantum information into classical geometry, simulating electromagnetic contributions through logarithmic corrections inspired by Kaluza-Klein compactification and deep learning's handling of hierarchical features.</reason>

        # <reason>The g_φφ component scales the spherical term with a polynomial-logarithmic-exponential-sigmoid product, representing extra-dimensional unfolding in Kaluza-Klein style, with attention-weighted residuals to compress angular information, aligning with deep learning decoders that reconstruct spacetime from high-dimensional encodings, geometrizing field effects through non-symmetric metric influences.</reason>

        # <reason>The g_tφ non-diagonal term introduces torsion-inspired modulation with cosine and sine functions combined with sigmoid, emulating vector potentials for electromagnetism via teleparallelism, with the small coefficient and high-frequency oscillations providing informational fidelity in decoding rotational effects from quantum states, inspired by attention mechanisms over temporal-angular coordinates.</reason>
