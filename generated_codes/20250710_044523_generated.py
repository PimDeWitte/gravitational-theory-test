class EinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelAttentionResidualTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory pursuits with teleparallelism and non-symmetric metrics, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-residual autoencoder that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via teleparallel torsion-inspired attention-weighted residuals, non-diagonal terms, and geometric unfoldings. Key features include residual attention-modulated tanh in g_tt for encoding field saturation with torsional effects, sigmoid and exponential residuals in g_rr for multi-scale decoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted logarithmic term in g_φφ for geometric compaction, and sine-modulated sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**3 * torch.tanh(beta * torch.exp(-gamma * (rs/r)**2))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.sigmoid(epsilon * (rs/r)**4) + zeta * torch.exp(-eta * (rs/r))), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + theta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**3) * torch.sigmoid(iota * rs/r)), g_tφ = kappa * (rs / r) * torch.sin(3 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(lambda_param * (rs/r))</summary>
