class TorsionAttentionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism for unifying gravity and electromagnetism through torsion, combined with deep learning attention mechanisms, where spacetime geometry acts as a decoder compressing high-dimensional quantum information via attention-weighted torsion terms. It introduces an attention-like softmax over torsion-inspired powers in g_tt for scale-dependent information fusion, a modified g_rr with quadratic correction mimicking teleparallel effects, and a non-diagonal g_tφ with radial attention decay for geometric encoding of fields. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r), (rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^3]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r), (rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^3]))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * (rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * torch.softmax(torch.tensor([1.0, torch.exp(-r / rs)]), dim=0)[1]</summary>
