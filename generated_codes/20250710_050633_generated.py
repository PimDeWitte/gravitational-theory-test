class EinsteinUnifiedTeleparallelGeometricKaluzaNonSymmetricResidualAttentionTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified teleparallel geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention tanh in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, sigmoid and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid exponential and polynomial term in g_φφ for geometric compaction and unfolding, and cosine-modulated sine sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel homer torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.03 * (rs/r)**6 * torch.tanh(0.12 * torch.exp(-0.21 * (rs/r)**4))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.3 * torch.sigmoid(0.4 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**3)) + 0.5 * torch.exp(-0.6 * (rs/r)**5)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.7 * (rs/r)**5 * torch.exp(-0.8 * (rs/r)**3) * torch.sigmoid(0.9 * (rs/r)**2)), g_tφ = 1.0 * (rs / r) * torch.cos(6 * rs / r) * torch.sin(4 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(1.1 * (rs/r)**3)</summary>
