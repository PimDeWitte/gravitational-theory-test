class KaluzaTeleparallelDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and Einstein's teleparallelism, treating the metric as a decoder in an autoencoder framework that reconstructs classical spacetime from compressed high-dimensional quantum information, encoding electromagnetism via torsion-inspired residuals and attention-weighted geometric unfoldings. Key features include sigmoid-activated residuals in g_tt and g_rr for decoding field strengths, an exponential decay in g_φφ mimicking extra-dimensional compaction, and a sine-based g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding rotational field effects. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**2 * torch.sigmoid(beta * (rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**2 * torch.sigmoid(beta * (rs/r)) + gamma * (rs/r)**4), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + delta * torch.exp(-epsilon * (r/rs))), g_tφ = zeta * (rs / r) * torch.sin(rs / r)</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by Kaluza-Klein, introduce a sigmoid-activated quadratic residual in g_tt to mimic the decoding of compressed extra-dimensional electromagnetic potentials into geometric curvature, analogous to an autoencoder's activation function for feature reconstruction; the sigmoid provides a bounded, non-linear compression to encode field-like effects without explicit charge.</reason>

        # <reason>Extend the residual to g_rr with an additional quartic term for higher-order geometric corrections, drawing from teleparallelism's torsion to encode asymmetric field influences; this acts as a residual connection in the decoder, enhancing stability in reconstructing spacetime from quantum information.</reason>

        # <reason>Incorporate an exponential decay scaling in g_φφ, inspired by Kaluza-Klein's compact dimensions unfolding at large scales; this behaves like an attention mechanism over radial distances, focusing the decoding on classical regimes while compressing quantum effects at small r.</reason>
