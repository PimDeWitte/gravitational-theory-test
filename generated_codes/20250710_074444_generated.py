    <summary>EinsteinDLInspiredTanhshrink0_5: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and teleparallelism, viewing spacetime as a deep learning autoencoder compressing high-dimensional quantum information. Introduces a tanhshrink-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r)^2 * tanhshrink(rs/r) with alpha=0.5 to emulate electromagnetic effects via residual, non-linear scale-dependent encoding (tanhshrink as a DL activation function subtracting tanh for better gradient flow in compression, acting as a self-residual correction mimicking interference in geometric encoding). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * torch.tanh(rs/r) for torsion-like interactions mimicking vector potentials, enabling geometric unification. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * tanhshrink(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * tanhshrink(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * torch.tanh(rs/r), where tanhshrink(x) = x - torch.tanh(x).</summary>
