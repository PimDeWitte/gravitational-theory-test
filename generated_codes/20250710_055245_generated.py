class EinsteinKaluzaHyperbolicAlpha0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's pursuit and Kaluza-Klein theory, introducing parameterized hyperbolic dilation in g_φφ and off-diagonal g_tφ with hyperbolic functions to encode electromagnetic-like effects via compact extra dimensions. This is viewed as a deep learning-inspired architecture where the tanh terms act as saturating activations in the autoencoder-like compression of high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime, providing bounded corrections for stable encoding. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * tanh(rs / r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * tanh(rs / r) * r, with alpha=0.5.</summary>
