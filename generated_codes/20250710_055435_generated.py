class EinsteinFinalUnifiedExpAlpha0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's final attempts to geometrize electromagnetism, introducing a parameterized exponential correction to encode repulsive effects akin to electromagnetic charges. This is viewed as a deep learning-inspired architecture where the exp term acts as a gating mechanism in the autoencoder-like compression of high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, providing decaying corrections over radial scales for stable encoding. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * exp(-rs / r)), g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs/r + alpha * exp(-rs / r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = 0, with alpha=0.5.</summary>
