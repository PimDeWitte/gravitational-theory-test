class KaluzaAttentionEncoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention mechanisms, treating the metric as an autoencoder that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical geometry, encoding electromagnetism via attention-weighted geometric terms. Key features include exponential attention decay in residuals for g_tt and g_rr to mimic field compaction, a sigmoid-scaled g_φφ for radial attention over extra-dimensional influences, and a hyperbolic tangent g_tφ for teleparallelism-inspired torsion encoding vector potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 * torch.exp(-beta * rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 * torch.exp(-beta * rs/r) + gamma * torch.log1p(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + delta / (1 + torch.exp(-epsilon * (r/rs)))), g_tφ = zeta * (rs / r) * torch.tanh(rs / r)</summary>

        # <reason>Drawing from Kaluza-Klein, introduce a residual term like (rs/r)^2 for extra-dimensional compaction, weighted by exp(-beta * rs/r) as an attention mechanism decaying over radial scales, compressing 'quantum' information into geometric curvature akin to Einstein's unification attempts; this encodes electromagnetism without explicit charge, treating it as geometric encoding loss minimization.</reason>
        g_tt = -(1 - rho + alpha * rho**2 * torch.exp(-beta * rho))

        # <reason>Similar to g_tt for consistency in the line element, but add a logarithmic correction inspired by quantum renormalization or autoencoder bottleneck compression, where log1p(rs/r) acts as a soft higher-order term to stabilize decoding of information across scales, echoing Einstein's non-symmetric metric pursuits for field unification.</reason>
        g_rr = 1 / (1 - rho + alpha * rho**2 * torch.exp(-beta * rho) + gamma * torch.log1p(rho))

        # <reason>Inspired by Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction, scale g_φφ with a sigmoid-like attention gate 1 / (1 + exp(-epsilon * (r/rs))), which acts as a soft switch activating extra-dimensional effects at larger radii, modeling information decompression from high-D quantum states to low-D classical angular geometry.</reason>
        g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + delta / (1 + torch.exp(-epsilon * (r / rs))))

        # <reason>For teleparallelism-like torsion, introduce non-diagonal g_tφ with tanh(rs/r) to encode vector potential effects geometrically, providing a smooth, bounded perturbation that mimics electromagnetic coupling without Q, as in Einstein's unified field efforts, while resembling a neural activation for information flow in the 'autoencoder' metric.</reason>
