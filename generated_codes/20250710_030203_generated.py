# <summary>Einstein Final: Parameterized modification inspired by Einstein's late unified field theory with non-symmetric metrics. Introduces geometric repulsion via alpha * (rs / r)^2 term mimicking EM charge effects and a non-diagonal g_tφ = beta * (rs / r)^2 for antisymmetric field coupling, reducing to GR at alpha=beta=0. Metric: phi = 1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2, g_tt = -phi, g_rr = 1/phi, g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = beta*(rs/r)^2.</summary>

        # <reason>Hardcode alpha for geometric repulsion term, inspired by Einstein's pursuit to derive EM from geometry, akin to Kaluza-Klein extra-dimensional charge; alpha=0 reduces to GR, non-zero adds RN-like repulsion as a 'compressed' high-dimensional effect emerging in 4D metric, like autoencoder bottleneck.</reason>
