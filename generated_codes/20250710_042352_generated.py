class EinsteinUnifiedLogCorrection1_0(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory drawing from Einstein's unified field pursuits and Kaluza-Klein ideas, introducing a parameterized geometric correction with alpha=1.0 that mimics electromagnetic repulsion via a logarithmic term in the metric, akin to scale-invariant attention in deep learning architectures for encoding quantum information across radial scales. The key metric components are g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log1p(rs / r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log1p(rs / r)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + alpha * (rs / r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.sin(torch.log(r / rs + 1e-10)), reducing to GR at alpha=0 but adding EM-like effects for alpha>0.</summary>
