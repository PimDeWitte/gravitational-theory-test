class EinsteinKKDLLogcosh0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>EinsteinKKDLLogcosh0_5: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning autoencoders with logcosh function, conceptualizing spacetime as a compressor of high-dimensional quantum information into geometric structures. Introduces a logcosh-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r)^2 * logcosh(rs/r) with alpha=0.5 to emulate electromagnetic effects via smooth, robust scale-dependent encoding (logcosh as a DL-inspired function providing quadratic near-horizon behavior and linear at large distances, acting as a residual connection for efficient information compression and mimicking repulsive forces). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * logcosh(rs/(2*r)) for torsion-like interactions inspired by teleparallelism, enabling geometric unification of vector potentials. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * logcosh(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * logcosh(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * logcosh(rs/(2*r)).</summary>
