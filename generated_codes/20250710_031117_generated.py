# <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metric attempts, introducing a parameterized off-diagonal term g_tφ to mimic electromagnetic effects geometrically, reducing to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r), g_φφ = r^2 + alpha * (rs**2 / r), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * r</summary>

        self.alpha = 0.5  # <reason>Fixed alpha=0.5 for this variant, allowing sweeps in testing; inspired by Einstein's parameterized unified models, where non-zero alpha introduces EM-like effects via geometric asymmetry, akin to antisymmetric tensor in unified field theories.</reason>

        g_tt = - (1 - rs / r)  # <reason>Retain GR's g_tt for gravitational attraction, ensuring reduction to Schwarzschild at alpha=0; this acts as the primary 'decoder' for time dilation, with information fidelity benchmarked against lossless GR.</reason>
        
        g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs / r)  # <reason>Standard inverse for radial component, maintaining isometric embedding of spacetime geometry; inspired by Einstein's pursuit of pure geometric derivations, avoiding explicit fields.</reason>
        
        g_φφ = r ** 2 + self.alpha * (rs ** 2 / r)  # <reason>Modify g_φφ with higher-order term alpha * (rs² / r), inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra-dimensional compactification effects leaking into angular metric; DL analogy: residual connection adding 'attention' over radial scales to encode potential quantum information into classical geometry.</reason>
        
        g_tφ = self.alpha * (rs / r) * r  # <reason>Introduce non-diagonal g_tφ = alpha * rs, a constant twist inspired by teleparallelism and non-symmetric metrics in Einstein's unified theories, aiming to geometrically encode electromagnetism (e.g., magnetic-like effects); at alpha=0, lossless to GR; DL view: cross-term as attention mechanism between temporal and angular coordinates, compressing high-D quantum states.</reason>
