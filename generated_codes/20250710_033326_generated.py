    # <summary>A unified field theory combining Einstein's non-symmetric and final attempts to geometrize electromagnetism, introducing both a parameterized repulsive term akin to electromagnetic effects in diagonal components and off-diagonal g_tÏ† terms for vector-like fields, reducing to GR at alpha=0. This hybrid is inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, where off-diagonal terms encode EM potentials, and viewed as a multi-layer autoencoder with residual connections for repulsion and attention-like off-diagonal mixing for quantum information compression into geometry. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (
