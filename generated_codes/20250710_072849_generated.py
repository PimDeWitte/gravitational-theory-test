class EinsteinCartanVAETheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein-Cartan theory with torsion and deep learning variational autoencoders (VAEs), modeling gravity as a torsional variational encoding of high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric includes Gaussian exponential terms for probabilistic latent sampling mimicking Cartan torsion effects, sinusoidal components for periodic spin-torsion couplings emulating electromagnetic fields, logarithmic terms for KL-divergence-like regularization, tanh for bounded torsional corrections, and a non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-(rs/r - 0.5)^2 / (2 * 0.1^2)) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.cos(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.cos(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r).</summary>
