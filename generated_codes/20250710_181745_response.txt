class EinsteinLogTorsionUnified(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's pursuit, using asymmetric metric components via non-diagonal g_tp to represent torsion for electromagnetism, logarithmic corrections for quantum-classical bridging, and alpha~1/137 coupling constant. Key metric: rs = 2*G*M/c^2, phi = 1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs^2/r^2)*log(1 + r/rs), g_tt = -phi, g_rr = 1/phi, g_pp = r^2, g_tp =
