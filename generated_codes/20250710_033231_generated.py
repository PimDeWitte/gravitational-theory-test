class EinsteinKaluzaInspiredAlpha0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's pursuit of unification and Kaluza-Klein theory, geometrizing electromagnetism via an off-diagonal g_tφ term mimicking vector potentials from extra dimensions, parameterized to introduce EM-like effects. Viewed as a deep learning-inspired compression where the off-diagonal acts as a residual connection encoding high-dimensional quantum data into geometric spacetime. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha * (rs**2 / r), with alpha=0.5.</summary>
