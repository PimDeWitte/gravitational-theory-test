class EinsteinUnifiedHierarchicalResidualMultiAttentionTeleparallelKaluzaQuantumTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning hierarchical residual and multi-attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric hierarchical residual-multi-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric multi-attention-weighted unfoldings, quantum-inspired terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include hierarchical multi-attention modulated residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with torsional and quantum effects, sigmoid and multi-scale exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for geometric encoding, attention-weighted polynomial and logarithmic terms in g_φφ for compaction and unfolding, and sine-cosine modulated sigmoid tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**12 * torch.tanh(beta * torch.sigmoid(gamma * torch.exp(-delta * (rs/r)**10))) + epsilon * (rs/r)**8 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**6)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + eta * torch.sigmoid(theta * torch.exp(-iota * torch.log1p((rs/r)**9))) + kappa * (rs/r)**11 + lambda_param * torch.tanh(mu * (rs/r)**7)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + nu * (rs/r)**10 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**8) * torch.exp(-xi * (rs/r)**6) * torch.sigmoid(omicron * (rs/r)**5) + pi * (rs/r)**4 * torch.tanh(rho * (rs/r)**3)), g_tφ = sigma * (rs / r) * torch.sin(tau * rs / r) * torch.cos(upsilon * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(phi * (rs/r)**7) * torch.tanh(chi * (rs/r)**4).</summary>
