class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricGeometricResidualAttentionTorsionInformationDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, information compression terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention sigmoid in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects and information encoding, tanh and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and exponential polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and information unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials with informational fidelity. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.009 * (rs/r)**9 * torch.sigmoid(0.08 * torch.tanh(0.17 * torch.exp(-0.26 * (rs/r)**7)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.35 * torch.tanh(0.44 * torch.exp(-0.53 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**6))) + 0.62 * (rs/r)**8), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.71 * (rs/r)**8 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**5) * torch.exp(-0.80 * (rs/r)**4) * torch.sigmoid(0.89 * (rs/r)**3)), g_tφ = 0.98 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(9 * rs / r) * torch.cos(7 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(1.07 * (rs/r)**5).</summary>
