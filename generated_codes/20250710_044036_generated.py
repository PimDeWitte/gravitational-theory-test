class UnifiedTeleparallelAttentionResidualTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory through teleparallelism and non-symmetric metrics, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual mechanisms, treating the metric as a residual-attention autoencoder that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via attention-weighted torsional residuals and non-diagonal geometric terms. Key features include attention-modulated residual terms in g_tt for encoding field saturation, exponential and sigmoid residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric decoding, tanh-attention in g_φφ for extra-dimensional residual unfolding, and cosine-sine modulated g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**4 * torch.sigmoid(beta * (rs/r)) * torch.exp(-gamma * rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.exp(-epsilon * (rs/r)**2) + zeta * torch.sigmoid(eta * (rs/r)**3)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + theta * (rs/r)**2 * torch.tanh(kappa * torch.exp(-iota * rs/r))), g_tφ = lambda_ * (rs / r) * torch.cos(2 * rs / r) * torch.sin(rs / r) * torch.tanh(rs / r)</summary>
