class EinsteinAutoencoderTorsionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's pursuit of unified field theory through teleparallelism and non-symmetric metrics, combined with deep learning autoencoder architectures, treating the metric as an autoencoder that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into geometric spacetime, encoding electromagnetism via torsion-inspired non-diagonal terms and residual corrections. Key features include autoencoder-like sigmoid activations in residuals for g_tt and g_rr to mimic information compression, a polynomial residual in g_φφ for extra-dimensional unfolding, and a cosine-modulated tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding vector-like potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sigmoid(beta * (rs/r)^2)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sigmoid(beta * (rs/r)^2) + gamma * (rs/r)^3), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + delta * (rs/r) + epsilon * (rs/r)^2), g_tφ = zeta * (rs / r) * torch.tanh(rs / r) * torch.cos(rs / r)</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by Einstein's unified field theory attempts to derive electromagnetism from geometry, this term introduces a sigmoid-activated residual correction to g_tt, mimicking an autoencoder's compression layer that encodes high-dimensional quantum effects into the gravitational potential, with the sigmoid acting as a non-linear activation for stable information encoding similar to neural network hidden layers.</reason>

        # <reason>Drawing from teleparallelism and residual networks, this reciprocal form for g_rr includes the sigmoid residual plus a cubic term, representing higher-order geometric corrections that decode electromagnetic-like effects from compressed spacetime geometry, with the cubic acting as a residual connection to handle multi-scale information fidelity.</reason>

        # <reason>Influenced by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and autoencoder decoders, this expands g_φφ with linear and quadratic residuals, unfolding compressed dimensional information into angular geometry, akin to a decoder reconstructing classical space from latent representations.</reason>

        # <reason>Inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metrics and teleparallel torsion, this non-diagonal g_tφ term uses a tanh-cosine modulation to encode field-like rotations and potentials geometrically, with tanh providing attention-like bounding and cosine introducing oscillatory behavior mimicking electromagnetic waves in a unified geometric framework.</reason>
