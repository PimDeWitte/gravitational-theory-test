    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning variational autoencoders (VAEs), modeling gravity as a variational encoding through compact extra dimensions that probabilistically maps high-dimensional quantum information to low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric includes Gaussian exponential terms for latent variable sampling, sinusoidal components for periodic extra-dimensional compactification mimicking electromagnetic fields, logarithmic terms for KL-divergence-like regularization, tanh for bounded corrections, and a non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-(rs/r - mu)^2 / (2 * sigma^2)) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.cos(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2).</summary>
