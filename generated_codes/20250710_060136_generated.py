class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricGeometricHierarchicalResidualAttentionQuantumTorsionFidelityAutoencoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning hierarchical residual and attention autoencoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric hierarchical residual-attention autoencoder that compresses and decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted hierarchical unfoldings, quantum-inspired information fidelity terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include hierarchical residual-modulated attention sigmoid in g_tt for encoding/decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects and quantum fidelity, tanh and multi-level exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and hierarchical exponential polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and quantum unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine tanh sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials with informational fidelity. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.004 * (rs/r)**12 * torch.sigmoid(0.05 * torch.tanh(0.10 * torch.exp(-0.15 * (rs/r)**10)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.20 * torch.tanh(0.25 * torch.exp(-0.30 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**9))) + 0.35 * torch.sigmoid(0.40 * (rs/r)**11)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.45 * (rs/r)**11 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**8) * torch.exp(-0.50 * (rs/r)**7) * torch.sigmoid(0.55 * (rs/r)**6)), g_tφ = 0.60 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(12 * rs / r) * torch.cos(10 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(0.65 * (rs/r)**8) * torch.sigmoid(0.70 * (rs/r)**9).</summary>
