# <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theories including Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, teleparallelism via torsion, non-symmetric metrics, and affine connections for geometrizing gravity and electromagnetism, combined with deep learning variational autoencoder and multi-head attention decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a variational decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information with probabilistic regularization for enhanced fidelity, multi-head attention for diverse scale-selective decoding, residual connections for multi-scale accuracy, compactification-inspired sigmoid operations, torsional logarithmic terms, non-symmetric oscillatory residuals, and affine-inspired expansions for comprehensive geometric unification without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (head1 + head2 + residual + variational)), where head1 = torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r), (rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^4]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r), (rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^4])), head2 = torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r)^3, (rs/r)^5, (rs/r)^6]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r)^3, (rs/r)^5, (rs/r)^6])) / (1 + torch.tanh((rs/r)^3)), residual = (rs/r)^5 / (1 + torch.sigmoid((rs/r)^2)), variational = -0.5 * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^6) * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)); g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^4) * torch.tanh((rs/r)^4)); g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)^5) * torch.exp(- (rs/r)^3) * torch.sin(rs/r)); g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * (1 + torch.softmax(torch.tensor([torch.sin(rs / r), torch.cos(rs / r), torch.tanh(rs / r)]), dim=0)[2] + torch.cos((rs / r)^3)).</summary>
