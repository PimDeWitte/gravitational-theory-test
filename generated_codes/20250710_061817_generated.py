# <summary>EinsteinKKDLLeakyReLU0_5: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning autoencoders with LeakyReLU activation, conceptualizing spacetime as a compressor of high-dimensional quantum information into geometric structures. Introduces a LeakyReLU-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r)^2 * leaky_relu(rs/r) with alpha=0.5 to emulate electromagnetic effects via non-linear, scale-dependent encoding (LeakyReLU as a DL activation function allowing small negative gradients for better information flow in compression, acting as a residual correction that handles quantum-like leaks at small scales). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * (1 - leaky_relu(rs/r)/(leaky_relu(rs/r) + 1)) for torsion-like interactions inspired by teleparallelism, enabling geometric unification of vector potentials. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * leaky_relu(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * leaky_relu(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * (1 - leaky_relu(rs/r)/(leaky_relu(rs/r) + 1)), where leaky_relu(x) = x if x >= 0 else 0.01 * x.</summary>
