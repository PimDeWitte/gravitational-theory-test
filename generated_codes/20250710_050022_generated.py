class UnifiedEinsteinTeleparallelKaluzaAttentionResidualNonSymmetricTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-residual decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified torsional attention-weighted residuals, non-symmetric geometric unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated tanh and sigmoid residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, exponential and logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, sigmoid-weighted exponential and polynomial term in g_φφ for compaction and unfolding, and cosine-modulated sine sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.1 * (rs/r)**5 * torch.tanh(0.2 * torch.sigmoid(0.3 * torch.exp(-0.4 * (rs/r)**3)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.5 * torch.exp(-0.6 * (rs/r)**4) + 0.7 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2) + 0.8 * torch.tanh(0.9 * (rs/r))), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 1.0 * (rs/r)**4 * torch.exp(-1.1 * rs/r) * torch.sigmoid(1.2 * (rs/r)**3)), g_tφ = 1.3 * (rs / r) * torch.cos(5 * rs / r) * torch.sin(4 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(1.4 * (rs/r)**2)</summary>
