class EinsteinUnifiedKaluzaTeleparallelGeometricResidualAttentionQuantumTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, quantum-inspired terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention sigmoid in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects and quantum encoding, tanh and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and quantum unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.008 * (rs/r)**9 * torch.sigmoid(0.09 * torch.tanh(0.18 * torch.exp(-0.27 * (rs/r)**7)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.36 * torch.tanh(0.45 * torch.exp(-0.54 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**6))) + 0.63 * (rs/r)**8), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.72 * (rs/r)**8 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**5) * torch.sigmoid(0.81 * (rs/r)**4)), g_tφ = 0.90 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(9 * rs / r) * torch.cos(7 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(0.99 * (rs/r)**5).</summary>
