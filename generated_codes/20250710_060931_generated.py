    """
    <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and deep learning diffusion models, modeling gravity as a teleparallel diffusive process that denoises high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric incorporates exponential diffusion kernels for torsional noise scheduling, tanh for bounded teleparallel corrections, cos for periodic field encodings, log for multi-scale entropy regularization, and a non-diagonal term for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2) * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.cos(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r) * (rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.cos(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2).</summary>
