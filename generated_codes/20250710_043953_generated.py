class EinsteinKaluzaTorsionAttentionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory pursuits using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-based autoencoder that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via torsion-inspired non-diagonal terms and attention-weighted residual corrections. Key features include attention-modulated exponential residuals in g_tt for geometric encoding of field compaction, sigmoid and logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale decoding, tanh-scaled polynomial in g_φφ for extra-dimensional attention unfolding, and sine-cosine modulated g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**3 * torch.exp(-beta * (rs/r)**2)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + gamma * torch.sigmoid(delta * (rs/r)) + epsilon * torch.log1p((rs/r)**3)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + zeta * (rs/r)**2 * torch.tanh(eta * rs/r)), g_tφ = theta * (rs / r) * torch.sin(rs / r) * torch.cos(2 * rs / r)</summary>
