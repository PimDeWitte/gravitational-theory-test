# <summary>EinsteinKKResidualSigmoid0_4: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and teleparallelism, conceptualizing spacetime as a deep learning autoencoder with residual connections for compressing quantum information. Introduces a sigmoid-activated repulsive term beta*(rs/r)^2 * sigmoid(rs/r) with beta=0.4 to emulate electromagnetic effects via non-linear, scale-dependent geometric encoding (sigmoid as a gating mechanism for information flow across radial scales, residual to GR). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = beta*(rs/r) * (1 - sigmoid(rs/r)) for torsion-like interactions mimicking vector potentials, enabling geometric unification. Reduces to GR at beta=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + beta*(rs/r)^2 * sigmoid(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + beta*(rs/r)^2 * sigmoid(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = beta*(rs/r) * (1 - sigmoid(rs/r)).</summary>
