class EinsteinUnifiedNonSymmetricTorsionResidualTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual mechanisms, treating the metric as a residual-based autoencoder that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via non-symmetric torsional residuals, attention-like non-diagonal terms, and geometric unfoldings. Key features include tanh-modulated logarithmic residuals in g_tt for saturated field encoding with non-symmetric effects, sigmoid and exponential residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric decoding inspired by teleparallelism, attention-weighted tanh in g_φφ for extra-dimensional scaling, and sine-modulated cosine in g_tφ for torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2) * torch.tanh(beta * (rs/r)**3)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + gamma * torch.sigmoid(delta * torch.exp(-epsilon * rs/r))), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + zeta * (rs/r)**2 * torch.tanh(eta * torch.log1p(rs/r))), g_tφ = theta * (rs / r) * torch.sin(2 * rs / r) * torch.cos(3 * rs / r)</summary>
