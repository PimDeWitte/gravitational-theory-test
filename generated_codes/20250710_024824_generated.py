        # <reason>Inspired by Einstein's final unified field theory attempts with non-symmetric metrics, where the antisymmetric part encodes electromagnetism geometrically. Here, we introduce a parameterized alpha to control the strength of unification, reducing to GR at alpha=0. The alpha term acts like a geometric 'charge' correction, mimicking EM repulsion via higher-order rs^2/r^2 terms, analogous to Reissner-Nordström but purely geometric, without explicit Q. This views the metric as a compression function, with the alpha term as a residual connection adding high-dimensional (quantum-like) information to the low-dimensional spacetime geometry.</reason>
        alpha = 0.5
        
        # <reason>Compute Schwarzschild radius rs as the base geometric scale, inspired by GR's pure geometry. This serves as the 'encoding' scale for mass information into curvature.</reason>
        rs = 2 * G_param * M_param / (C_param ** 2)
        
        # <reason>For g_tt, modify the GR form with an alpha-dependent term alpha * (rs / r)^2, which introduces a repulsive correction at short ranges, similar to EM in RN metric. This is like adding a positive 'potential' term, reducing effective attraction, and can be seen as decoding quantum repulsion from geometric encoding. At alpha=0, it recovers Schwarzschild exactly.</reason>
        delta = 1 - (rs / r) + alpha * (rs / r) ** 2
        g_tt = -delta
        
        # <reason>For g_rr, take the reciprocal of delta to maintain the isotropic form like in GR and RN, ensuring the metric is consistent with Einstein's geometric unification spirit. This acts as an autoencoder-like inversion, decoding the radial stretching.</reason>
        g_rr = 1 / delta
        
        # <reason>For g_φφ, use the standard r^2 but add a small alpha-dependent logarithmic correction, inspired by quantum corrections or DL attention mechanisms over radial scales (log for multi-scale). This subtly modifies angular geometry to encode potential higher-dimensional information, like in Kaluza-Klein, without extra dimensions explicitly.</reason>
        g_phiphi = r ** 2 * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs / r)))
        
        # <reason>Introduce a non-zero g_tφ to capture antisymmetric metric components, inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric unified theory where off-diagonal terms represent EM fields. The form alpha * (rs ** 2 / r) acts like a geometric 'twist' or teleparallel-inspired torsion, adding a field-like effect without explicit vectors. In DL terms, this is like an attention cross-term between time and angular directions, mixing information channels for better 'decoding' of unified forces. At alpha=0, it vanishes, recovering GR.</reason>
        g_tphi = alpha * (rs ** 2 / r)
