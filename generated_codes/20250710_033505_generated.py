class EinsteinUnifiedLogAlpha0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's pursuit of geometrizing electromagnetism, introducing a parameterized logarithmic correction to encode repulsive effects akin to electromagnetic charges. This is viewed as a deep learning-inspired regularization in the metric's compression of high-dimensional quantum information, with the log term acting like an attention mechanism over multi-scale radial dependencies. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * log(1 + (rs/r))), g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs/r + alpha * log(1 + (rs/r))), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = 0, with alpha=0.5.</summary>
