class EinsteinFinalTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A parameterized geometric unification inspired by Einstein's final attempts at a unified field theory, using a non-symmetric-like metric with a repulsive quadratic term and a non-diagonal cross-term to emulate electromagnetism from pure geometry. Reduces to GR when alpha=beta=0. Key metric: B = 1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2, g_tt = -B, g_rr = 1/B, g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = -beta * (rs^2 / r), with alpha=0.5, beta=0.1.</summary>

        self.beta = 0.1   # <reason>Parameter for non-diagonal coupling, drawing from Einstein's non-symmetric metric ideas, mimicking EM vector potential; in DL terms, like a cross-attention weight between temporal and angular dimensions for enhanced decoding fidelity.</reason>
