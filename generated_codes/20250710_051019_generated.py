# <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention tanh in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, sigmoid and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and exponential terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and unfolding, and cosine-modulated sine sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.02 * (rs/r)**6 * torch.tanh(0.13 * torch.sigmoid(0.24 * torch.exp(-0.35 * (rs/r)**4)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.46 * torch.sigmoid(0.57 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**5)) + 0.68 * torch.exp(-0.79 * (rs/r)**3)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.81 * (rs/r)**5 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**3) * torch.exp(-0.92 * (rs/r)**2) * torch.sigmoid(1.03 * (rs/r))), g_tφ = 1.14 * (rs / r) * torch.cos(6 * rs / r) * torch.sin(4 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(1.25 * (rs/r)**3)</summary>
