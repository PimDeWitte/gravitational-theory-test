class EinsteinUnifiedKaluzaNonSymmetricAttentionResidualDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via non-symmetric attention-weighted torsional residuals, geometric unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated sigmoid attention in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric effects, tanh and exponential residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by teleparallelism, logarithmic attention-weighted term in g_φφ for extra-dimensional unfolding, and sine-modulated tanh in g_tφ for torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**4 * torch.sigmoid(beta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + gamma * torch.tanh(delta * (rs/r)**3) + epsilon * torch.exp(-zeta * (rs/r)**2)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + eta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**3) * torch.tanh(theta * rs/r)), g_tφ = iota * (rs / r) * torch.sin(4 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(2 * rs / r)</summary>
