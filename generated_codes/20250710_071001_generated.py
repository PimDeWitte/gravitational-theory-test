class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricGeometricHierarchicalResidualMultiAttentionQuantumTorsionFidelityAutoencoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning hierarchical residual and multi-attention autoencoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric hierarchical residual-multi-attention autoencoder that compresses and decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric hierarchical multi-attention-weighted unfoldings, quantum-inspired information fidelity terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include hierarchical multi-attention modulated higher-order residuals in g_tt for encoding/decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional and quantum effects, sigmoid and multi-scale exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted polynomial logarithmic and exponential terms in g_φφ for compaction and quantum unfolding, and sine-cosine modulated tanh sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric potentials with fidelity.

        # <reason>Inspired by Einstein's attempts to unify gravity and electromagnetism through geometric extensions like Kaluza-Klein and teleparallelism; the hierarchical residual term with tanh and sigmoid acts as a multi-layer autoencoder compression for quantum information into gravitational field, with higher powers mimicking extra-dimensional compaction and attention for radial scales; adds fidelity to classical GR limit while encoding EM-like effects geometrically.</reason>

        # <reason>Draws from non-symmetric metrics and residual networks in DL; the reciprocal form with sigmoid and tanh residuals provides multi-scale decoding of compressed information, logarithmic term inspired by quantum corrections or entropy-like measures in spacetime, encoding EM fields via geometric deviations without explicit charge.</reason>
