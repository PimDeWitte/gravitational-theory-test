class UnifiedEinsteinTeleparallelKaluzaNonSymmetricHierarchicalResidualMultiAttentionQuantumTorsionInformationDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning hierarchical residual and multi-attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric hierarchical residual-multi-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric multi-attention-weighted unfoldings, quantum-inspired information compression terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include hierarchical multi-attention modulated residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional and quantum effects, sigmoid and multi-scale exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted polynomial logarithmic and exponential terms in g_φφ for compaction and quantum information unfolding, and sine-cosine modulated tanh sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials with informational fidelity. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.004 * (rs/r)**12 * torch.tanh(0.05 * torch.sigmoid(0.10 * torch.exp(-0.15 * (rs/r)**10))) + 0.002 * (rs/r)**8 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**6)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.20 * torch.sigmoid(0.25 * torch.exp(-0.30 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**9))) + 0.35 * torch.tanh(0.40 * (rs/r)**11) + 0.15 * (rs/r)**5 * torch.exp(-0.45 * (rs/r)**3)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.50 * (rs/r)**11 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**8) * torch.exp(-0.55 * (rs/r)**7) * torch.sigmoid(0.60 * (rs/r)**6) + 0.25 * (rs/r)**4 * torch.tanh(0.65 * (rs/r)**2)), g_tφ = 0.70 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(12 * rs / r) * torch.cos(10 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(0.75 * (rs/r)**7) * torch.sigmoid(0.80 * (rs/r)**4).</summary>
