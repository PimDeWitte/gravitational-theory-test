class HermitianFlowTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's Hermitian unified field theory and deep learning normalizing flows, modeling gravity as an invertible Hermitian flow that transforms quantum information into geometric spacetime. The metric incorporates sinh and cosh for hyperbolic flow transformations mimicking complex Hermitian structures, exp decays for flow density, log terms for entropy, sinusoidal for periodic effects, and a non-diagonal term for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sinh(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.cosh(rs/r) * (rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.sinh(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r).</summary>
