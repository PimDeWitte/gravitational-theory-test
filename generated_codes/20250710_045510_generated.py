class NonSymmetricAffineKaluzaResidualAttentionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric unified field theory for geometrizing electromagnetism, affine unified field theory for fields without curvature, and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions for unifying gravity and electromagnetism, combined with deep learning residual attention decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information through residual attention mechanisms for multi-scale selective fidelity, non-symmetric residuals for electromagnetic encoding, affine-inspired logarithmic terms for non-Riemannian unification, and compactification-like sigmoid expansions for geometric fidelity without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * ((rs/r)^4 / (1 + torch.exp(- (rs/r)^3)) + torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^5]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^5])) )), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^4) * torch.tanh((rs/r)^2)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)^5)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * (1 + torch.softmax(torch.tensor([torch.sin(rs / r), torch.cos(rs / r)]), dim=0)[0])</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric and affine theories for geometric unification, combined with Kaluza-Klein compactification and DL residual attention decoders; the base GR term ensures gravitational foundation, while the added residual decoder term with inverse exp decompresses torsional-like information, and the attention sum selectively fuses multi-scale radial powers for encoding high-dimensional quantum info into geometry, mimicking non-symmetric residuals for electromagnetism.</reason>

        # <reason>Drawing from affine unified theory's non-Riemannian connections and teleparallel-like corrections, with DL-inspired logarithmic term modulated by tanh for residual multi-scale effects; this correction in g_rr introduces affine-inspired deviations for unifying fields geometrically, compressing quantum scales logarithmically while ensuring stability via hyperbolic damping.</reason>
