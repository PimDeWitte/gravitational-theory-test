class AffineResidualTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's affine unified field theory and deep learning residual networks, modeling gravity as an affine geometric structure with residual connections that add higher-order corrections for encoding electromagnetic-like fields. The metric includes residual quadratic and logarithmic terms for multi-scale information compression, exponential decay for regularization, and a non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * (rs/r)^3 * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 * (1 + torch.log(1 + rs/r))), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * (rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * torch.tanh(rs/r).</summary>
