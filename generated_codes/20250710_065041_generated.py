# <summary>EinsteinKKDLSELU0_5: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning autoencoders with SELU activation, viewing spacetime as a compressor of high-dimensional quantum information into geometric structures. Introduces a SELU-activated repulsive term delta*(rs/r)^2 * selu(rs/r) with delta=0.5 to emulate electromagnetic effects via self-normalizing, non-linear scale-dependent encoding (SELU as a DL activation function promoting stable information propagation in compression networks, acting as a residual correction that maintains variance in geometric encoding across scales). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = delta*(rs/r)^2 * (1 - selu(rs/r)/ (selu(rs/r) + 1.0507)) for torsion-like interactions inspired by teleparallelism, enabling geometric unification of vector potentials. Reduces to GR at delta=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + delta*(rs/r)^2 * selu(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta*(rs/r)^2 * selu(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = delta*(rs/r)^2 * (1 - selu(rs/r)/ (selu(rs/r) + 1.0507)), where selu(x) = 1.0507 * (x if x >= 0 else 1.67326 * (torch.exp(x) - 1)).</summary>
