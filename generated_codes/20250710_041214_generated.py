class NonSymmetricResidualAttentionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metrics and deep learning residual attention mechanisms, treating the metric as an autoencoder-like structure that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via attention-weighted residuals and non-diagonal torsional terms. Key features include tanh-activated quadratic residuals in g_tt for information saturation, exponential decay residuals in g_rr for long-range geometric encoding, sigmoid-scaled g_φφ for attention over angular dimensions inspired by Kaluza-Klein, and sine-modulated g_tφ for teleparallelism-like torsion encoding rotational field effects. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**2 * torch.tanh(beta * rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + gamma * torch.exp(-delta * rs/r) + epsilon * (rs/r)**4), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + zeta * torch.sigmoid(eta * (rs/r))), g_tφ = theta * (rs / r) * torch.sin(kappa * rs / r) * torch.tanh(rs / r)</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metrics and autoencoder compression, the tanh activation serves as an attention mechanism to saturate higher-order quadratic residuals, encoding electromagnetic-like effects through non-linear geometric curvature adjustments, mimicking information bottleneck in deep learning for unified gravity-EM theory.</reason>

        # <reason>Drawing from residual networks and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, the exponential decay term acts as a residual connection for long-range information encoding, while the quartic term provides higher-order corrections for geometric unification, compressing quantum fluctuations into classical spacetime.</reason>

        # <reason>Motivated by teleparallelism and non-symmetric metrics in Einstein's unified field theory, the sine-modulated tanh introduces torsion-like non-diagonal elements to encode vector potentials for electromagnetism, with the modulation providing oscillatory attention over scales for information fidelity in the decoder analogy.</reason>
