# <summary>EinsteinKKInspiredExp0_6: A unified field theory variant drawing from Einstein's Kaluza-Klein approach with extra dimensions and deep learning residual connections, conceptualizing spacetime as an autoencoder compressing quantum information. Introduces a geometric repulsive term alpha*(rs/r) * exp(-rs/r) with alpha=0.6 to emulate electromagnetic repulsion via scale-dependent exponential decay (inspired by attention mechanisms decaying over distance), acting as a residual correction to GR. Includes off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * (1 - exp(-rs/r)) for torsion-like effects mimicking vector potentials in teleparallelism, enabling geometric encoding of field interactions. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r) * exp(-rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r) * exp(-rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * (1 - exp(-rs/r)).</summary>
