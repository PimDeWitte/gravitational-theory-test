class EinsteinUnifiedTorsionResidualAttentionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using teleparallelism and non-symmetric metrics, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention mechanisms, treating the metric as a residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via torsion-inspired non-diagonal terms, attention-weighted residuals, and geometric unfoldings. Key features include attention-modulated tanh residuals in g_tt for saturated field decoding, exponential and sigmoid residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding, logarithmic attention in g_φφ for extra-dimensional scaling, and cosine-sine modulated g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**4 * torch.tanh(beta * torch.exp(-gamma * (rs/r)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.exp(-epsilon * (rs/r)**3) + zeta * torch.sigmoid(eta * (rs/r)**2)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + theta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2) * torch.tanh(iota * rs/r)), g_tφ = kappa * (rs / r) * torch.cos(3 * rs / r) * torch.sin(rs / r)</summary>
