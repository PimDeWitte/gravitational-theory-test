class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricGeometricResidualAttentionTorsionInformationDecoderTheoryV5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, information compression terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention tanh in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects and information encoding, sigmoid and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and exponential polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and information unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials with informational fidelity. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.005 * (rs/r)**10 * torch.tanh(0.06 * torch.sigmoid(0.12 * torch.exp(-0.18 * (rs/r)**8)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.24 * torch.sigmoid(0.30 * torch.exp(-0.36 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**7))) + 0.42 * torch.tanh(0.48 * (rs/r)**9)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.54 * (rs/r)**9 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**6) * torch.exp(-0.60 * (rs/r)**5) * torch.sigmoid(0.66 * (rs/r)**4)), g_tφ = 0.72 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(10 * rs / r) * torch.cos(8 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(0.78 * (rs/r)**6).</summary>
