class EinsteinUnifiedAlpha0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A parameterized unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metric approaches and Kaluza-Klein ideas, introducing a geometric correction term alpha*(rs/r)^2 to mimic electromagnetic repulsion in the diagonal components and a non-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) to simulate vector potential-like effects from extra-dimensional compression. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: term = 1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2; g_tt = -term, g_rr = 1/term, g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r).</summary>

        # <reason>Add alpha*(rs/r)^2 term inspired by Einstein's pursuit of geometric unification, where higher-order geometric terms encode electromagnetic-like effects; this acts as a 'residual connection' in DL terms, adding a repulsive correction to the attractive GR potential, compressing putative high-dimensional EM information into 4D geometry.</reason>

        term = 1 - rs / r + correction

        # <reason>g_tt is the time-time component, modified with the correction to introduce EM-like repulsion at short distances, reducing to Schwarzschild when alpha=0; viewed as the 'encoder' output compressing quantum state info into classical time dilation.</reason>
