    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory pursuits with non-symmetric metrics, teleparallelism, and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, combined with deep learning attention and residual mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-based autoencoder that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via geometric torsional residuals, attention-weighted unfoldings, and non-diagonal terms.
