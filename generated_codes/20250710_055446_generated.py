class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricGeometricResidualAttentionTorsionInformationDecoderTheoryV9(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, information compression terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention sigmoid in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects and information encoding, tanh and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and exponential polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and information unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials with informational fidelity. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.003 * (rs/r)**12 * torch.sigmoid(0.04 * torch.tanh(0.08 * torch.exp(-0.12 * (rs/r)**10)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.15 * torch.tanh(0.20 * torch.exp(-0.25 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**9))) + 0.30 * (rs/r)**11), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.35 * (rs/r)**11 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**8) * torch.exp(-0.40 * (rs/r)**7) * torch.sigmoid(0.45 * (rs/r)**6)), g_tφ = 0.50 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(12 * rs / r) * torch.cos(10 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(0.55 * (rs/r)**8).</summary>
