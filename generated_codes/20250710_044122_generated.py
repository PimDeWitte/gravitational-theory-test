class EinsteinKaluzaResidualAttentionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory pursuits with non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention mechanisms, treating the metric as a residual-attention autoencoder that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via attention-weighted geometric residuals and torsion-inspired non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual tanh-modulated exponential attention in g_tt for encoding field compaction, sigmoid and polynomial residuals in g_rr for multi-scale information decoding, attention-scaled logarithmic term in g_φφ for extra-dimensional unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**3 * torch.tanh(beta * torch.exp(-gamma * rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.sigmoid(epsilon * (rs/r)**2) + zeta * (rs/r)**4), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + eta * torch.log1p((rs/r)) * torch.sigmoid(theta * rs/r)), g_tφ = iota * (rs / r) * torch.sin(2 * rs / r) * torch.cos(rs / r)</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by Einstein's attempts to unify gravity and electromagnetism through geometric modifications, this g_tt includes a higher-order cubic term modulated by a tanh of an exponential attention mechanism to mimic residual connections in deep learning autoencoders, encoding electromagnetic-like field compaction as a geometric compression of high-dimensional quantum information into classical gravity, similar to Kaluza-Klein scalar fields emerging from extra dimensions.</reason>

        # <reason>Drawing from teleparallelism where torsion encodes fields, this g_rr incorporates a sigmoid-activated quadratic residual for attention-like weighting of short-range effects and a quartic polynomial for long-range geometric corrections, acting as a multi-scale decoder in the autoencoder framework to reconstruct spacetime from compressed quantum states, avoiding explicit charge but implying electromagnetic encoding via non-symmetric geometry.</reason>

        # <reason>Inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, this g_φφ adds a logarithmic term scaled by a sigmoid attention function to unfold angular dimensions, representing the compression of higher-dimensional information into observable classical geometry, with the sigmoid providing a soft gating mechanism like in deep learning attention layers for radial scale focus.</reason>

        # <reason>To encode electromagnetism geometrically as in Einstein's non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, this non-diagonal g_tφ uses a sine-modulated cosine term to introduce torsion-like effects mimicking vector potentials, with the modulation providing oscillatory behavior analogous to residual connections attending over angular and temporal coordinates for unified field representation.</reason>
