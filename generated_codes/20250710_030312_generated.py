class EinsteinFinalTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's final attempts at unified field theory, using a parameterized non-symmetric metric to geometrically encode electromagnetism-like effects. The key modification is an alpha parameter introducing a repulsive term akin to charge in Reissner-Nordström, plus a small off-diagonal g_tφ for field asymmetry: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs^2 / r^3).</summary>

        # <reason>Define alpha as a fixed parameter (0.5) to introduce a geometric modification mimicking electromagnetic repulsion, reducing to GR at alpha=0; this is inspired by Einstein's pursuit of deriving EM from geometry, like in Kaluza-Klein, where extra dimensions encode fields, here parameterized as a higher-order term acting like a 'residual connection' in DL autoencoders to capture quantum-like corrections.</reason>
