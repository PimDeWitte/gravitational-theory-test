class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricGeometricResidualAttentionTorsionInformationDecoderTheoryV6(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, information compression terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention tanh in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects and information encoding, sigmoid and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and exponential polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and information unfolding, and cosine-modulated sine sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials with informational fidelity. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.004 * (rs/r)**11 * torch.tanh(0.05 * torch.sigmoid(0.10 * torch.exp(-0.15 * (rs/r)**9)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.20 * torch.sigmoid(0.25 * torch.exp(-0.30 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**8))) + 0.35 * torch.tanh(0.40 * (rs/r)**10)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.45 * (rs/r)**10 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**7) * torch.exp(-0.50 * (rs/r)**6) * torch.sigmoid(0.55 * (rs/r)**5)), g_tφ = 0.60 * (rs / r) * torch.cos(11 * rs / r) * torch.sin(9 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(0.65 * (rs/r)**7).</summary>
