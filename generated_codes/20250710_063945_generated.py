# <summary>A theory drawing from Einstein's unified field pursuits and Kaluza-Klein ideas, introducing a parameterized geometric correction with alpha=1.0 that mimics electromagnetic repulsion via a softplus-activated higher-order term in the metric, akin to smooth rectification units in deep learning architectures for encoding quantum information with a soft threshold at intermediate radial scales. The key metric components are g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.softplus(rs / r - 0.5) * (rs/r)^2), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.softplus(rs / r - 0.5) * (rs/r)^2), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.softplus(rs / r - 0.5)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.softplus(r / rs - 1.0), reducing to GR at alpha=0 but adding EM-like effects for alpha>0.</summary>

        # <reason>g_tt incorporates the standard GR term -(1 - rs/r) and adds a positive correction alpha * torch.softplus(rs / r - 0.5) * (rs/r)^2 to mimic electromagnetic repulsion geometrically, inspired by Einstein's pursuit of unifying fields through metric modifications and analogous to softplus activation in deep learning autoencoders that selectively encodes high-dimensional information into the geometry for r where rs/r > 0.5, promoting stability in the "compressed" classical spacetime.</reason>
        g_tt = -(1 - rs / r + alpha * torch.softplus(rs / r - 0.5) * (rs / r) ** 2)

        # <reason>g_rr is set as the inverse of the potential term in g_tt to maintain the spherically symmetric form akin to Schwarzschild and RN solutions, ensuring consistency with Einstein's geometric approach while the softplus-gated correction encodes additional "electromagnetic-like" information, similar to how residual connections in neural networks preserve information flow across layers.</reason>
        g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs / r + alpha * torch.softplus(rs / r - 0.5) * (rs / r) ** 2)

        # <reason>g_φφ modifies the standard r^2 with a multiplicative factor (1 + alpha * torch.softplus(rs / r - 0.5)) to introduce a subtle angular distortion, drawing from Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions where compactified scales encode electromagnetic fields, akin to attention mechanisms in deep learning that weigh information across scales for better compression of quantum states into classical geometry.</reason>

        # <reason>g_tφ introduces an off-diagonal term alpha * (rs / r) * torch.softplus(r / rs - 1.0) to mimic electromagnetic vector potentials geometrically, inspired by teleparallelism and non-symmetric metrics in Einstein's unified theories, functioning like a gated residual connection in deep learning that activates for larger r to encode rotational or magnetic-like effects from higher-dimensional quantum information.</reason>
