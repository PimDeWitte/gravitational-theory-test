    """
    <summary>A parameterized unified field theory inspired by Einstein's final attempts with non-symmetric metrics and Kaluza-Klein ideas, introducing a geometric repulsion term alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) in the metric potential to mimic electromagnetic effects, and a non-diagonal g_tφ = beta * (rs / r)^2 for torsion-like field effects. Reduces to GR when alpha=0 and beta=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs^2 / r^2)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) + (beta^2 * (rs^2 / r^2))/r^2), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = beta * (rs / r)^2.</summary>
