class EinsteinUnifiedSinhAlpha0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's final attempts to geometrize electromagnetism, introducing a parameterized hyperbolic sine correction to encode repulsive effects akin to electromagnetic charges. This is viewed as a deep learning-inspired architecture where the sinh term acts as an activation function in the autoencoder-like compression of high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, providing exponential growth in corrections for stronger unification effects. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * sinh(rs / r)), g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs/r + alpha * sinh(rs / r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = 0, with alpha=0.5.</summary>

        alpha = 0.5
        # <reason>Fixed parameter alpha=0.5 to control the strength of the unifying correction, allowing sweep-like testing; at alpha=0, reduces to pure GR, embodying Einstein's pursuit of geometric EM inclusion.</reason>

        factor = 1 - rs / r + correction

        # <reason>Radial component as inverse of the factor to maintain metric consistency and light-like geodesics similar to GR, ensuring the geometric structure supports unified field dynamics.</reason>
