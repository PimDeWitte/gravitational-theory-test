class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricGeometricMultiResidualAttentionQuantumTorsionFidelityAutoencoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning multi-residual and attention autoencoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric multi-residual-attention autoencoder that compresses and decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional multi-residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, quantum-inspired fidelity terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include multi-residual attention-modulated tanh and sigmoid in g_tt for encoding/decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional and quantum effects, exponential and multi-logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted multi-polynomial and exponential terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and quantum unfolding, and sine-cosine modulated multi-tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials with fidelity. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.005 * (rs/r)**12 * torch.tanh(0.06 * torch.sigmoid(0.12 * torch.exp(-0.18 * (rs/r)**10))) + 0.003 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**4) * torch.exp(-0.09 * (rs/r)**2)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.24 * torch.sigmoid(0.30 * torch.exp(-0.36 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**9))) + 0.42 * torch.tanh(0.48 * (rs/r)**11) + 0.15 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**5)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.54 * (rs/r)**11 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**8) * torch.exp(-0.60 * (rs/r)**7) * torch.sigmoid(0.66 * (rs/r)**6) + 0.27 * (rs/r)**3 * torch.tanh(0.33 * (rs/r)**4)), g_tφ = 0.72 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(12 * rs / r) * torch.cos(10 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(0.78 * (rs/r)**8) * torch.sigmoid(0.84 * (rs/r)**2).</summary>
