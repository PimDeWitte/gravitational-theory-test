class EinsteinKaluzaUnifiedTeleparallelNonSymmetricGeometricAttentionResidualTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric attention-residual decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated sigmoid and tanh residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, exponential and logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, sigmoid-weighted logarithmic and polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.008 * (rs/r)**8 * torch.sigmoid(0.09 * torch.tanh(0.18 * torch.exp(-0.27 * (rs/r)**6)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.36 * torch.exp(-0.45 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**5)) + 0.54 * torch.tanh(0.63 * (rs/r)**4)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.72 * (rs/r)**7 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**4) * torch.sigmoid(0.81 * (rs/r)**3)), g_tφ = 0.9 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(8 * rs / r) * torch.cos(6 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(0.99 * (rs/r)**4).</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metrics and DL attention, this adds a high-order sigmoid-tanh-modulated exponential residual to g_tt, mimicking attention-weighted compression of electromagnetic-like effects into geometry, with small coefficient for minimal perturbation to GR while encoding field saturation.</reason>

        # <reason>Inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and attention mechanisms, this scales g_φφ with a sigmoid-weighted logarithmic polynomial term, simulating attention over radial scales for unfolding compacted dimensions into classical geometry.</reason>
