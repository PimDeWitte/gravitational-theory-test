    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theories including non-symmetric metrics, teleparallelism, affine connections, and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions for geometrizing gravity and electromagnetism, combined with deep learning multi-scale residual attention decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information through multi-scale residual attention mechanisms for selective fidelity across scales, incorporating torsional sigmoid operations, affine logarithmic terms, compactification-inspired expansions, and non-symmetric oscillatory residuals for comprehensive geometric unification without explicit charges.
