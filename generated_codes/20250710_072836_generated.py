class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricHierarchicalResidualAttentionQuantumTorsionFidelityDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning hierarchical residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a hierarchical residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric hierarchical attention-weighted unfoldings, quantum-inspired information fidelity terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include hierarchical attention-modulated higher-order residuals in g_tt for multi-level decoding of field saturation with non-symmetric torsional and quantum effects, sigmoid and multi-scale exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted polynomial logarithmic and exponential terms in g_φφ for hierarchical compaction and quantum unfolding, and sine-cosine modulated tanh sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials with fidelity.
