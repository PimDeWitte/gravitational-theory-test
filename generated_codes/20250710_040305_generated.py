class DecoderTeleparallelTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism for unifying gravity and electromagnetism through torsion, combined with deep learning decoder architectures, where spacetime geometry acts as an informational decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum states into classical geometry via inverse-like operations and residual connections. It introduces a decoder-inspired inverse exponential term in g_tt for decompressing scale information, a torsion-motivated higher-order correction in g_rr mimicking teleparallel gravity, a modified g_φφ with logarithmic expansion for extra-dimensional decoding, and a non-diagonal g_tφ with attention-like softmax modulation for geometric encoding of electromagnetic effects without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha / (1 + torch.exp(rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^4), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r))), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r), torch.exp(-r / rs)]), dim=0)[0]</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by decoder architectures in deep learning that decompress information through inverse operations (e.g., inverse sigmoid or exp), this term in g_tt adds a decompression-like correction to the standard Schwarzschild potential, mimicking the decoding of compressed quantum information into classical gravity, drawing from Einstein's pursuit of geometric unification where higher-order terms encode additional fields.</reason>

        # <reason>Drawing from teleparallelism where torsion replaces curvature, this g_rr includes a higher-order (rs/r)^4 term as a residual connection to capture multi-scale effects, acting like a decoder layer that refines the metric for stable classical spacetime reconstruction without explicit electromagnetic charges.</reason>

        # <reason>Inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and autoencoder expansions, this logarithmic term in g_φφ simulates a decoding expansion of angular components, compressing high-dimensional information geometrically as Einstein envisioned in unified theories.</reason>

        # <reason>To encode electromagnetic-like effects geometrically per Einstein's non-symmetric metrics, this g_tφ uses a softmax-weighted term as an attention mechanism over radial scales, providing a non-diagonal coupling that mimics field interactions without charges, akin to teleparallel torsion inducing electromagnetism.</reason>
