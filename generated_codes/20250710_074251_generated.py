class EinsteinTeleDLSinh0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>EinsteinTeleDLSinh0_5: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and deep learning autoencoders with sinh activation, viewing spacetime as a compressor of high-dimensional quantum information. Introduces a sinh-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r)^2 * sinh(rs/r) with alpha=0.5 to emulate electromagnetic effects via non-linear, exponentially growing scale-dependent encoding (sinh as a hyperbolic activation function for residual corrections, capturing asymmetric information flow in compression). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * (cosh(rs/r) - 1) for torsion-inspired interactions mimicking vector potentials, enabling geometric unification. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * sinh(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * sinh(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * (cosh(rs/r) - 1).</summary>

        # <reason>Add off-diagonal g_tφ with cosh-based term (complementary to sinh, ensuring positivity and vanishing at large r), inspired by teleparallelism's torsion for geometric electromagnetism, simulating vector potential effects like in Kaluza-Klein, and functioning as an attention mechanism over angular scales for unified field encoding.</reason>
