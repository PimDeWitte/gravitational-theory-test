class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricGeometricHierarchicalResidualMultiAttentionQuantumTorsionFidelityAutoencoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning hierarchical residual and multi-attention autoencoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric hierarchical residual-multi-attention autoencoder that compresses and decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric hierarchical multi-attention-weighted unfoldings, quantum-inspired information fidelity terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include hierarchical autoencoder-like multi-attention modulated higher-order residuals in g_tt for encoding/decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional and quantum effects, sigmoid and multi-scale exponential logarithmic residuals with attention in g_rr for geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted polynomial logarithmic and exponential terms in g_φφ for compaction and quantum unfolding, and sine-cosine modulated tanh sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric potentials with fidelity. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**12 * torch.tanh(beta * torch.sigmoid(gamma * torch.exp(-delta * (rs/r)**10))) + epsilon * (rs/r)**8 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**6) + zeta * torch.exp(-eta * (rs/r)**4)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + theta * torch.sigmoid(iota * torch.tanh(kappa * torch.exp(-lambda_param * torch.log1p((rs/r)**9)))) + mu * (rs/r)**11 + nu * torch.log1p((rs/r)**7)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + xi * (rs/r)**10 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**8) * torch.exp(-omicron * (rs/r)**6) * torch.sigmoid(pi * (rs/r)**5) + rho * (rs/r)**4 * torch.tanh(sigma * (rs/r)**3)), g_tφ = tau * (rs / r) * torch.sin(upsilon * rs / r) * torch.cos(phi * rs / r) * torch.tanh(chi * (rs/r)**7) * torch.sigmoid(psi * (rs/r)**4).</summary>
