# <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and deep learning attention mechanisms, modeling gravity as an attentional compression over scales. The metric incorporates torsion-like logarithmic corrections for multi-scale quantum information encoding and a non-diagonal term for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * (rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r) * (1 + alpha * (rs/r)^2), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * (rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * rs * torch.exp(-rs/r).</summary>

        alpha = 0.1  # <reason>Alpha parameterizes the strength of teleparallel-inspired corrections, akin to Einstein's torsion in teleparallel gravity, allowing sweeps to test unification; inspired by attention weights in DL for scaling importance of quantum corrections.</reason>

        g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * (rs/r))  # <reason>Base Schwarzschild term extended with logarithmic correction inspired by teleparallelism's flat spacetime with torsion, encoding multi-scale information like DL attention over radial distances; log term compresses high-dim effects into geometry.</reason>
        g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r) * (1 + alpha * (rs/r)**2)  # <reason>Inverse base with quadratic residual, mimicking autoencoder residual connections for higher-order geometric encoding, deviating from symmetry to introduce field-like effects without explicit charge.</reason>
        g_phiphi = r**2 * (1 + alpha * (rs/r))  # <reason>Angular component with linear correction, inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions compressing information, acting as a bottleneck for angular momentum encoding.</reason>
