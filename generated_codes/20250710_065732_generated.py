class EinsteinCartanTransformerTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein-Cartan theory with torsion and deep learning transformer architectures, modeling gravity as a torsional self-attention mechanism over radial scales that encodes high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric includes sinusoidal positional encodings for torsional corrections mimicking electromagnetic fields, exponential attention for scale weighting, logarithmic terms for multi-scale compression, tanh for bounded attention outputs, and a non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.cos(2 * rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2) * (rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.cos(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r).</summary>
