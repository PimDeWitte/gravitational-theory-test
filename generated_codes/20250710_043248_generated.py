class KaluzaBottleneckTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein approach and deep learning bottleneck architectures, where extra-dimensional compression acts as an informational bottleneck encoding electromagnetic effects geometrically. The metric includes a softplus bottleneck term for quantum information compression, exponential decay for scale attention, and a non-diagonal term mimicking Kaluza-Klein unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 * torch.softplus(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^3 * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.exp(-rs/r).</summary>

        g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**3 * torch.exp(-rs/r))  # <reason>Inverse form with cubic term and exponential decay, representing radial attention that focuses information at event horizon scales, akin to DL attention mechanisms and teleparallel torsion for multi-scale encoding.</reason>
