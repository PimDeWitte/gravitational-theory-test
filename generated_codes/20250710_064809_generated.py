class EinsteinTeleDLLogcosh0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>EinsteinTeleDLLogcosh0_5: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, conceptualizing spacetime as a deep learning autoencoder compressing high-dimensional quantum information. Introduces a logcosh-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r)^2 * logcosh(rs/r) with alpha=0.5 to emulate electromagnetic effects via smooth, scale-dependent geometric encoding (logcosh as a DL-inspired smooth loss function behaving quadratically near zero and exponentially at large scales, acting as a residual correction for information fidelity in compression). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * (logcosh(rs/r) - torch.log(torch.tensor(2.0))) for torsion-inspired interactions mimicking vector potentials, enabling geometric unification. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * logcosh(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * logcosh(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * (logcosh(rs/r) - torch.log(torch.tensor(2.0))), where logcosh(x) = torch.log(torch.cosh(x)).</summary>
