# <summary>EinsteinKKInspiredCosh0_8: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning autoencoders, viewing spacetime as a compressor of high-dimensional quantum information into geometric structures. Introduces a cosh-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r) * (cosh(rs/r) - 1) with alpha=0.8 to emulate electromagnetic effects via exponential scale-dependent encoding (cosh - 1 as a smooth, positive activation function acting like a residual connection for growing repulsion at small scales, inspired by hyperbolic functions in DL for efficient gradient flow in compression). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * sinh(rs/r) for torsion-like interactions mimicking vector potentials in teleparallelism, enabling geometric unification. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r) * (cosh(rs/r) - 1)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r) * (cosh(rs/r) - 1)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * sinh(rs/r).</summary>
