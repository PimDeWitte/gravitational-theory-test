class EinsteinUnifiedSinhAlpha0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's final attempts to geometrize electromagnetism, introducing a parameterized hyperbolic sine correction to encode repulsive effects akin to electromagnetic charges. This is viewed as a deep learning-inspired architecture where the sinh term acts as an unbounded activation function in the autoencoder-like compression of high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, allowing for exponential corrections at small radial scales. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * sinh(rs / r)), g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs/r + alpha * sinh(rs / r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = 0, with alpha=0.5.</summary>

        rs = 2 * G_param * M_param / C_param**2
        # <reason>Schwarzschild radius rs is computed as the base gravitational scale, inspired by GR, serving as the compression bottleneck in the autoencoder analogy for encoding mass information into geometry.</reason>
        alpha = torch.tensor(0.5)
        # <reason>Alpha parameterizes the strength of the unified correction, allowing sweeps to test fidelity; set to 0.5 for this variant, reducing to pure GR geometry at alpha=0, akin to Einstein's tunable geometric extensions.</reason>
        correction = alpha * torch.sinh(rs / r)
        # <reason>The hyperbolic sine term introduces a non-linear, unbounded correction that approximates linear for large r (weak field) but exponential for small r (strong field), mimicking EM repulsion geometrically; inspired by Einstein's pursuit of pure geometry for fields, viewed as a DL activation function providing residual attention to high-curvature regimes in the spacetime compression.</reason>
        g_tt = -(1 - rs / r + correction)
        # <reason>Time-time component includes the standard GR term plus the sinh correction to encode repulsive effects, reducing gravitational pull akin to charge in RN, but purely geometric; this acts as the primary encoder layer in the autoencoder-inspired metric.</reason>
        g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs / r + correction)
        # <reason>Radial component is inverted to maintain metric consistency, ensuring proper decoding of geodesics; this mirrors the structure in charged GR metrics but derives from geometric unification attempts.</reason>
        g_phiphi = r**2
        # <reason>Angular component remains standard, focusing unification effects on radial and time directions to preserve asymptotic flatness and spherical symmetry, like in Einstein's symmetric metric bases.</reason>
        g_tphi = torch.zeros_like(r)
        # <reason>No off-diagonal term in this variant to emphasize diagonal modifications for EM-like repulsion, simplifying the geometric encoding while allowing future extensions for vector potentials ala Kaluza-Klein.</reason>
