class MultiHeadAttentionUnifiedDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theories including non-symmetric metrics, teleparallelism, affine connections, and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions for geometrizing gravity and electromagnetism, combined with deep learning multi-head attention decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information through multi-head attention mechanisms for capturing diverse scale-selective fidelity, incorporating torsional sigmoid operations, affine logarithmic terms, compactification-inspired expansions, and non-symmetric oscillatory residuals for comprehensive geometric unification without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (head1 + head2)), where head1 = torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r), (rs/r)^3, (rs/r)^5]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r), (rs/r)^3, (rs/r)^5])), head2 = torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^4, (rs/r)^6]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^4, (rs/r)^6])) / (1 + torch.tanh((rs/r)^3)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^4) * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)^2)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.exp(- (rs/r)^3) * torch.tanh((rs/r)^4)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * (1 + torch.softmax(torch.tensor([torch.sin(rs / r), torch.cos(rs / r), torch.tanh(rs / r)]), dim=0)[0] + torch.softmax(torch.tensor([torch.exp(-r / rs), (rs/r)]), dim=0)[1])</summary>
