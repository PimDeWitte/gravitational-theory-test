class TeleparallelTransformerTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and deep learning transformer architectures, modeling gravity as a teleparallel connection with transformer-like self-attention over radial scales for encoding quantum information into geometry. The metric includes sinusoidal positional encodings for torsional corrections mimicking electromagnetic fields, exponential attention for scale weighting, logarithmic terms for multi-scale compression, and a non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r) * (1 + torch.log(1 + rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.cos(rs/r) * (rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.cos(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r).</summary>
