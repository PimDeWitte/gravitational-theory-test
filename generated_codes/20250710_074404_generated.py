class EinsteinUnifiedHierarchicalResidualQuantumGeometricTorsionAttentionAutoencoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning hierarchical residual and attention autoencoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric hierarchical residual-attention autoencoder that compresses and decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, hierarchical attention-weighted unfoldings, quantum-inspired information fidelity terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include hierarchical residual-modulated attention in g_tt for encoding/decoding field saturation with torsional and quantum effects, multi-scale sigmoid and exponential residuals in g_rr for geometric encoding, attention-weighted multi-order logarithmic and polynomial terms in g_φφ for compaction and unfolding, and sine-cosine modulated tanh sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.005 * (rs/r)**12 * torch.tanh(0.06 * torch.sigmoid(0.12 * torch.exp(-0.18 * (rs/r)**10))) + 0.003 * (rs/r)**7 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**5) * torch.exp(-0.04 * (rs/r)**3)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.25 * torch.sigmoid(0.30 * torch.exp(-0.35 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**9))) + 0.40 * torch.tanh(0.45 * (rs/r)**11) + 0.02 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**4)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.50 * (rs/r)**10 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**8) * torch.exp(-0.55 * (rs/r)**6) * torch.sigmoid(0.60 * (rs/r)**5) + 0.01 * (rs/r)**4 * torch.tanh(0.02 * (rs/r)**2)), g_tφ = 0.65 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(12 * rs / r) * torch.cos(10 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(0.70 * (rs/r)**7) * torch.sigmoid(0.75 * (rs/r)**4).</summary>
