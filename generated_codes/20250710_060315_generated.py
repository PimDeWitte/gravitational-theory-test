class EinsteinUnifiedKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricResidualAttentionQuantumTorsionAutoencoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention autoencoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention autoencoder that compresses and decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, quantum-inspired fidelity terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**3 * torch.tanh(beta * torch.exp(-gamma * (rs/r)**2))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.sigmoid(epsilon * (rs/r)**4) + zeta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + eta * (rs/r)**2 * torch.exp(-theta * (rs/r)) * torch.sigmoid(iota * (rs/r)**3)), g_tφ = kappa * (rs / r) * torch.sin(3 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(lambda_param * (rs/r)**2).</summary>
