class EinsteinUnifiedRegularized1_0(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory drawing from Einstein's unified field pursuits and Kaluza-Klein ideas, introducing a parameterized geometric correction with alpha=1.0 that mimics electromagnetic repulsion via a regularized inverse-square term in the metric, akin to epsilon-regularized norms in deep learning architectures for stable encoding of quantum information without divergences. The key metric components are g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs**2 / (r**2 + rs**2))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs**2 / (r**2 + rs**2))), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + alpha * (rs**2 / (r**2 + rs**2))), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.cos(r / rs), reducing to GR at alpha=0 but adding EM-like effects for alpha>0.</summary>

        alpha = 1.0
        # <reason>Define alpha as a scalar parameter controlling the strength of the unification correction, allowing sweeps and reducing to GR when alpha=0, inspired by Einstein's parameterized approaches to unified theories.</reason>
        term = alpha * torch.div(rs**2, r**2 + rs**2)
        # <reason>This regularized term draws from Kaluza-Klein compactification, providing a geometric analog to electromagnetic charge squared over r squared, but softened near r=0 to prevent singularities, akin to adding epsilon in deep learning normalizations for stable information compression and avoiding instabilities in quantum-to-classical decoding.</reason>
        g_tt = -(1 - torch.div(rs, r) + term)
        # <reason>The g_tt component includes the repulsive correction to weaken gravitational attraction, mimicking the effect of electric charge in Reissner-Nordström, conceptualized as geometry encoding high-dimensional EM information, with the sign ensuring repulsive contribution.</reason>
        g_rr = torch.reciprocal(1 - torch.div(rs, r) + term)
        # <reason>The g_rr is the inverse to maintain consistency with the line element form in modified GR theories, ensuring the metric remains a valid decoder of spacetime geometry from unified fields.</reason>
        g_phi_phi = r**2 * (1 + term)
        # <reason>Slight modification to the angular component inspired by extra dimensions in Kaluza-Klein, where compactified directions can induce small dilaton-like scalings, akin to residual scaling in deep learning for hierarchical feature encoding.</reason>
        g_t_phi = alpha * torch.div(rs, r) * torch.cos(torch.div(r, rs))
        # <reason>The off-diagonal g_tφ introduces a vector potential-like term, inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and Kaluza-Klein gauge fields, with cosine oscillation to model periodic effects from compact dimensions, similar to attention over periodic features in deep learning for capturing long-range correlations.</reason>
