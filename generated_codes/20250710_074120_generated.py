    <summary>EinsteinTeleDLCosh0_4: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, conceptualizing spacetime as a deep learning autoencoder compressing high-dimensional quantum information. Introduces a cosh-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r) * (cosh(rs/r) - 1) with alpha=0.4 to emulate electromagnetic effects via non-linear, exponentially growing scale-dependent geometric encoding (cosh-1 as a smooth, positive activation function acting like a residual connection for repulsive forces, inspired by hyperbolic attention mechanisms in DL for long-range interactions). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * sinh(rs/r) for torsion-inspired interactions mimicking vector potentials, enabling geometric unification. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r) * (cosh(rs/r) - 1)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r) * (cosh(rs/r) - 1)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * sinh(rs/r).</summary>
