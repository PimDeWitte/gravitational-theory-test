# <summary>EinsteinKKInspiredGelu0_4: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning autoencoders with GELU activation, viewing spacetime as a compressor of high-dimensional quantum information into geometric structures. Introduces a GELU-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r)^2 * gelu(rs/r) with alpha=0.4 to emulate electromagnetic effects via non-linear, probabilistic scale-dependent encoding (GELU as a gating mechanism from transformers for smooth information flow and compression, acting as residual correction). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * (1 - sigmoid(1.702 * rs/r)) for torsion-like interactions inspired by teleparallelism, enabling geometric unification of vector potentials. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * gelu(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * gelu(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * (1 - sigmoid(1.702 * rs/r)), where gelu(x) ≈ x * sigmoid(1.702 * x).</summary>
