class ResidualGeometricTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>Inspired by Einstein's unified field theory attempts (e.g., Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions) and deep learning autoencoders with residual connections, this theory treats the metric as a compression function encoding high-dimensional quantum information. It adds a residual term alpha*(rs/r)**2 to mimic electromagnetic repulsion geometrically, like a residual skip connection preserving information across scales, and a small non-diagonal g_tφ = beta*(rs/r) inspired by Kaluza-Klein off-diagonal terms for vector potentials, aiming to unify gravity and EM without explicit charge. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)**2), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)**2), g_φφ = r**2, g_tφ = beta*(rs/r).</summary>

        # <reason>Residual term alpha*(rs/r)**2 mimics the r^{-2} electromagnetic contribution in Reissner-Nordström geometrically, without Q, viewing it as a deep learning residual connection that adds higher-order quantum information directly to the low-dimensional geometric output, inspired by Einstein's attempts to derive EM from geometry.</reason>

        pot = 1 - term_grav + term_res
        # <reason>Combined potential integrates gravitational and residual terms, hypothesizing a unified encoding where EM emerges from geometric 'attention' over radial scales (r^{-2} emphasizing short-range effects).</reason>

        g_tt = -pot
        # <reason>g_tt as -pot follows GR convention, with the residual addition aiming to reproduce EM-like repulsion for orbital stability, testing informational fidelity in decoding quantum states to classical spacetime.</reason>

        g_rr = 1 / pot
        # <reason>Inverse for g_rr ensures metric consistency, with the unified pot allowing geometric mimicry of charged black hole horizons, inspired by Kaluza-Klein compactification compressing extra-dimensional info.</reason>

        g_phiphi = r ** 2
        # <reason>Standard angular component, unchanged to maintain spherical symmetry, focusing unification efforts on temporal and radial components as primary encoders.</reason>

        g_tphi = self.beta * (rs / r)
        # <reason>Non-diagonal g_tφ = beta*(rs/r) introduces a Kaluza-Klein-inspired off-diagonal term, simulating vector potential for EM unification, like a subtle torsion or antisymmetric metric component in Einstein's non-symmetric attempts, adding rotational encoding for potential magnetic-like effects.</reason>
