    # <summary>EinsteinKKDLGELU0_6: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning autoencoders with GELU activation, conceptualizing spacetime as a compressor of high-dimensional quantum information into geometric structures. Introduces a GELU-activated repulsive term epsilon*(rs/r)^2 * gelu(rs/r) with epsilon=0.6 to emulate electromagnetic effects via non-linear, probabilistic scale-dependent encoding (GELU as a smooth activation function acting like a gated residual connection for adaptive information flow, inspired by transformer architectures focusing on relevant quantum features across radial scales). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = epsilon*(rs/r)^1.5 * gelu(1 - rs/r) for torsion-like interactions mimicking vector potentials in teleparallelism, enabling geometric unification. Reduces to GR at epsilon=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + epsilon*(rs/r)^2 * gelu(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + epsilon*(rs/r)^2 * gelu(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = epsilon*(rs/r)^1.5 * gelu(1 - rs/r).</summary>
