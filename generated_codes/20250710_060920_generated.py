# <summary>EinsteinKKDLGelu0_6: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning autoencoders with GELU activation, viewing spacetime as a compressor of high-dimensional quantum information into geometric structures. Introduces a GELU-activated repulsive term delta*(rs/r)^2 * gelu(rs/r) with delta=0.6 to emulate electromagnetic effects via non-linear, probabilistic scale-dependent encoding (GELU as a DL activation function incorporating stochastic regularization-like residuals for adaptive information compression, mimicking quantum fluctuations in geometric terms). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = delta*(rs/r) * (1 - gelu(rs/r)) for torsion-like interactions inspired by teleparallelism, enabling geometric unification of vector potentials. Reduces to GR at delta=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + delta*(rs/r)^2 * gelu(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta*(rs/r)^2 * gelu(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = delta*(rs/r) * (1 - gelu(rs/r)), where gelu(x) ≈ 0.5 * x * (1 + torch.tanh(torch.sqrt(2/torch.pi) * (x + 0.044715 * x**3))).</summary>
