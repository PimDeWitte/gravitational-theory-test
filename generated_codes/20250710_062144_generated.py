class EinsteinCartanFlowTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein-Cartan theory with torsion and deep learning normalizing flows, modeling gravity as a torsional invertible flow that transforms high-dimensional quantum distributions into low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric includes tanh for invertible flow activations, exp for density scalings, sin for periodic torsional effects mimicking Cartan torsion, log for multi-scale entropy regularization, rational terms for flow invertibility, and a non-diagonal term for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2) * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r) / (1 + torch.tanh(rs/r)) * torch.cos(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.exp(-rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r).</summary>
