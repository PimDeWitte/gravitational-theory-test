class EinsteinAsymmetricAutoencoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric unified field theory and deep learning autoencoders, viewing the metric as an asymmetric autoencoder that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via non-symmetric residuals, torsional non-diagonal terms, and attention-like activations. Key features include asymmetric tanh and sigmoid residuals in g_tt and g_rr for encoding field asymmetries geometrically, an exponentially modulated g_φφ inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, and a sinh-modulated g_tφ for teleparallelism-like torsion introducing asymmetric vector potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**2 * torch.tanh(beta * rs/r) + gamma * torch.sigmoid(delta * (rs/r)**3)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + epsilon * (rs/r)**3 * torch.tanh(zeta * rs/r) + eta * torch.sigmoid(theta * (rs/r)**2)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + iota * torch.exp(-kappa * (rs/r)) + lambda_ * (rs/r)**4), g_tφ = mu * (rs / r) * torch.sinh(nu * rs / r) * torch.cos(rs / r)</summary>
