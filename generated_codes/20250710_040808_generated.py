class KaluzaTeleparallelAttentionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra-dimensional unification and teleparallelism for gravity via torsion, combined with deep learning attention mechanisms, where spacetime geometry acts as a multi-scale decoder compressing high-dimensional quantum information through attention-weighted compactification and torsional terms for geometric encoding of electromagnetism without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^4, (rs/r)^6]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^4, (rs/r)^6]))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^2)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)^3)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * torch.softmax(torch.tensor([torch.sin(rs / r), torch.exp(- (r / rs))]), dim=0)[0]</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions for unifying fields and teleparallelism's torsion for gravity, combined with attention for multi-scale quantum information decoding; the attention-weighted sum over even powers mimics compactified dimensional contributions to energy density, compressing high-dimensional info into g_tt like an autoencoder bottleneck.</reason>

        # <reason>Drawing from teleparallelism's flat curvature with torsion and Kaluza-Klein's extra-dimensional effects, the logarithmic correction in g_rr acts as a torsional perturbation encoding multi-scale information, similar to residual connections in decoders for stable decompression.</reason>

        # <reason>Inspired by Kaluza-Klein's compact extra dimensions modifying angular components, the sigmoid term provides a smooth, bounded expansion mimicking decoded geometric effects from higher dimensions, like attention focusing on relevant scales.</reason>
