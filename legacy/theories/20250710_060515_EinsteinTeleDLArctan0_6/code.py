# <summary>EinsteinTeleDLArctan0_6: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, conceptualizing spacetime as a deep learning autoencoder compressing high-dimensional quantum information. Introduces an arctan-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r)^2 * atan(rs/r) with alpha=0.6 to emulate electromagnetic effects via non-linear, bounded scale-dependent geometric encoding (arctan as a smooth activation function for residual corrections, saturating at large scales like attention mechanisms focusing on relevant information). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * (pi/2 - atan(rs/r)) for torsion-inspired interactions mimicking vector potentials, enabling geometric unification. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * atan(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * atan(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * (pi/2 - atan(rs/r)).</summary>
