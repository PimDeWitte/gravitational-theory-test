class EinsteinNonSymmetricAttentionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric unified field theory and deep learning attention mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-based autoencoder that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via non-symmetric attention-weighted residuals and torsional non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated tanh residuals in g_tt for saturated geometric encoding of fields, logarithmic and exponential residuals in g_rr for multi-scale information decoding, polynomial attention in g_φφ inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, and cosine-tanh modulated g_tφ for teleparallelism-like torsion encoding asymmetric potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**2 * torch.tanh(beta * (rs/r) * torch.exp(-gamma * rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2) + epsilon * torch.exp(-zeta * (rs/r))), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + eta * (rs/r) * torch.sigmoid(theta * rs/r) + iota * (rs/r)**3), g_tφ = kappa * (rs / r) * torch.cos(rs / r) * torch.tanh(2 * rs / r)</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metrics for unifying gravity and electromagnetism, introduce attention-modulated tanh residual to g_tt to encode field-like effects geometrically, mimicking autoencoder compression of quantum information with saturation for stability, and exponential decay in attention for radial focus akin to Kaluza-Klein compaction.</reason>
