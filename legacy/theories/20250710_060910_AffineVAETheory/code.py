    <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's affine unified field theory and deep learning variational autoencoders (VAEs), modeling gravity as an affine variational encoding of high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric includes Gaussian exponential terms for probabilistic latent sampling, logarithmic terms for KL-divergence-like regularization, tanh for bounded affine corrections, sinusoidal components for periodic field encodings, and a non-diagonal term for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2 / 2) * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2).</summary>
