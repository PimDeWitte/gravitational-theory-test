class EinsteinUnifiedHyperbolicAlpha0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's final attempts to geometrize electromagnetism, introducing a parameterized hyperbolic correction to encode repulsive effects akin to electromagnetic charges. This is viewed as a deep learning-inspired architecture where the tanh term acts as a gating mechanism in the autoencoder-like compression of high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, providing bounded corrections over radial scales. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * tanh(rs / r)), g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs/r + alpha * tanh(rs / r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = 0, with alpha=0.5.</summary>

        # <reason>The Schwarzschild radius rs/r term provides the standard gravitational attraction, forming the base of the geometric encoding of mass, inspired by Einstein's GR as the 'encoder' of classical information.</reason>
        base = 1 - rs / r

        # <reason>The alpha * tanh(rs / r) term introduces a bounded repulsive correction mimicking electromagnetic effects geometrically, reducing to zero at alpha=0 to recover GR; the hyperbolic tangent acts like a DL gating function (e.g., in GRUs) to softly attend to near-horizon vs. asymptotic scales, compressing high-dimensional quantum fluctuations into stable geometry.</reason>
        correction = alpha * torch.tanh(rs / r)

        # <reason>g_tt incorporates the correction as an addition to the potential, akin to the +rq^2/r^2 in Reissner-Nordström, but geometrized via tanh for smooth, bounded repulsion, viewed as a non-linear residual in the information encoding process.</reason>
        g_tt = -(base + correction)

        # <reason>g_rr is the inverse to maintain the metric structure, ensuring the geometry remains a valid 'decoder' of spacetime intervals, with the correction enhancing stability like a normalization layer in DL architectures.</reason>
        g_rr = 1 / (base + correction)

        # <reason>g_φφ remains r^2 as the standard angular part, preserving isotropy in the geometric compression, without dilation to focus on tt/rr modifications for EM-like repulsion.</reason>
        g_phiphi = r ** 2

        # <reason>g_tφ is zero to keep the metric diagonal, emphasizing pure geometric modifications inspired by Einstein's final unified field attempts without torsion or off-diagonal fields.</reason>
