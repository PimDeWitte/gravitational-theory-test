class UnifiedEinsteinGeometricTeleparallelKaluzaNonSymmetricResidualAttentionTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention sigmoid in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, tanh and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.01 * (rs/r)**8 * torch.sigmoid(0.1 * torch.tanh(0.2 * torch.exp(-0.3 * (rs/r)**6)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.4 * torch.tanh(0.5 * torch.exp(-0.6 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**5))) + 0.7 * (rs/r)**7), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.8 * (rs/r)**6 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**4) * torch.sigmoid(0.9 * (rs/r)**3)), g_tφ = 1.0 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(8 * rs / r) * torch.cos(6 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(1.1 * (rs/r)**4).</summary>
