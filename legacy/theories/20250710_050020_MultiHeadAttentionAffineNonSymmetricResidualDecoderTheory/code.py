    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's affine unified field theory for geometrizing fields without curvature and non-symmetric unified field theory for geometrizing electromagnetism, combined with deep learning multi-head attention and residual decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information through multi-head attention for diverse scale-selective fidelity, residual connections for multi-scale accuracy, affine-inspired logarithmic operations for non-Riemannian encoding, and non-symmetric oscillatory terms for unifying fields geometrically without explicit charges.
