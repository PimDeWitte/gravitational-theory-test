class NonSymmetricAttentionTorsionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric unified field theory, Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, and deep learning attention mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-based decoder that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via non-symmetric torsional residuals and attention-weighted geometric terms. Key features include tanh-modulated exponential residuals in g_tt for saturated field encoding, sigmoid and logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale decoding, exponential attention in g_φφ for extra-dimensional unfolding, and sine-tanh modulated g_tφ for teleparallelism-like torsion encoding asymmetric potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**3 * torch.tanh(beta * torch.exp(-gamma * rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.sigmoid(epsilon * (rs/r)**2) + zeta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**4)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + eta * torch.exp(-theta * (rs/r)) * torch.tanh(kappa * rs/r)), g_tφ = iota * (rs / r) * torch.sin(2 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(rs / r)</summary>
