class EinsteinUnifiedArctanAlpha0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's final attempts to geometrize electromagnetism, introducing a parameterized arctan correction to encode repulsive effects akin to electromagnetic charges. This is viewed as a deep learning-inspired architecture where the arctan term acts as a smooth transition mechanism in the autoencoder-like compression of high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, providing bounded corrections over radial scales for stable encoding. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * arctan(rs / r)), g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs/r + alpha * arctan(rs / r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = 0, with alpha=0.5.</summary>

        # <reason>The arctan correction is introduced to provide a bounded, smooth repulsive term similar to electromagnetic effects, inspired by Einstein's geometrization of fields and analogous to activation functions in deep learning for gradual feature encoding in the metric's compression of quantum information.</reason>
        correction = self.alpha * torch.arctan(rs / r)
        # <reason>This form of g_tt combines the standard Schwarzschild attractive potential with the geometric correction, reducing to GR when alpha=0, and viewing the addition as a residual connection enhancing the encoding of high-dimensional information into low-dimensional geometry.</reason>
        g_tt = - (1 - rs / r + correction)
        # <reason>g_rr is set as the inverse to maintain consistency with the structure of GR and charged solutions like Reissner-Nordström, ensuring the metric acts as a faithful decoder of orbital dynamics, inspired by Einstein's pursuit of unified geometric descriptions.</reason>
        g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs / r + correction)
        # <reason>The standard r^2 term for g_φφ is retained without modification to focus the unification on temporal and radial components, analogous to keeping core layers unchanged in a deep autoencoder while modifying others for specialized encoding.</reason>
        g_phiphi = r ** 2
