class NonSymmetricAttentionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metric approach and deep learning attention mechanisms, modeling gravity as an attentional compression of high-dimensional quantum information into asymmetric geometric spacetime. The metric incorporates exponential attention weights for radial scale focusing, logarithmic terms for multi-scale information encoding, tanh for bounded asymmetric corrections, sinusoidal components for periodic field effects, and a non-diagonal term for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r).</summary>
