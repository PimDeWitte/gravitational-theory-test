class TeleparallelResidualDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and deep learning residual decoders, viewing the metric as a decoder that reconstructs classical spacetime from compressed quantum information, encoding electromagnetism via torsion-like residuals and geometric attention. Key features include residual logarithmic terms in g_tt and g_rr for decoding higher-dimensional effects, a polynomial expansion in g_φφ mimicking extra-dimensional unfolding, and a cosine-based g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding field rotations. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + beta * (rs/r)**3 + alpha * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + gamma * (rs/r) + delta * (rs/r)**2), g_tφ = epsilon * (rs / r) * torch.cos(rs / r)</summary>
