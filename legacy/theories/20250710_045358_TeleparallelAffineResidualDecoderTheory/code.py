class TeleparallelAffineResidualDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism for gravity via torsion and affine unified field theory for geometrizing fields without curvature, combined with deep learning residual decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information through residual connections for multi-scale fidelity, torsional inverse operations for geometric gravity, and affine-inspired terms for unifying electromagnetism geometrically without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * ((rs/r)^2 / (1 + torch.exp(- (rs/r))) + torch.tanh((rs/r)^3) * (rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^4)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)^2)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * (1 + torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r), torch.cos(rs / r)]), dim=0)[1])</summary>
