class EinsteinUnifiedAlpha1_0(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory drawing from Einstein's unified field pursuits and Kaluza-Klein ideas, introducing a parameterized geometric correction with alpha=1.0 that mimics electromagnetic repulsion via a higher-order term in the metric, akin to a residual connection in deep learning architectures for encoding additional information. The key metric components are g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.sin(r / rs), reducing to GR at alpha=0 but adding EM-like effects for alpha>0.</summary>

        alpha = 1.0  # <reason>Alpha is a dimensionless parameter inspired by Einstein's attempts to unify gravity and EM through geometric modifications, such as in non-symmetric metrics or extra dimensions; here it controls the strength of a repulsive correction term, allowing sweeps to test unification hypotheses, analogous to hyperparameters in deep learning for compression efficiency.</reason>
        rs = 2 * G_param * M_param / (C_param ** 2)  # <reason>Schwarzschild radius computed with fundamental constants, serving as the base scale for geometric terms, reflecting GR's foundation while allowing extensions inspired by teleparallelism or Kaluza-Klein compactification.</reason>
        term1 = rs / r  # <reason>Standard GR attractive term, representing the core gravitational encoding of mass information into spacetime curvature.</reason>
        term2 = alpha * (rs / r) ** 2  # <reason>Higher-order repulsive term inspired by RN's charge contribution and DL residual connections, viewing it as an additional layer compressing quantum-like information (e.g., EM fields) into geometry; mimics EM repulsion without explicit charge, aligning with Einstein's pure geometry goal.</reason>
        phi = 1 - term1 + term2  # <reason>Combined potential factor, where the +term2 introduces repulsion, potentially decoding EM from geometry, testable via loss against RN benchmark.</reason>
        g_tt = -phi  # <reason>Time-time component, modified to include geometric unification term, reducing to Schwarzschild at alpha=0.</reason>
        g_rr = 1 / phi  # <reason>Radial component, inverted for consistency with metric signature, ensuring the theory remains a valid decoder of orbital dynamics.</reason>
        g_phiphi = r ** 2  # <reason>Angular component, unchanged to preserve spherical symmetry, focusing modifications on radial encoding akin to attention over scales in DL.</reason>
        g_tphi = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.sin(r / rs)  # <reason>Off-diagonal term inspired by Kaluza-Klein (e.g., metric components from extra dimensions inducing EM potentials) and non-symmetric metrics in Einstein's work; the sin modulation adds a periodic geometric effect, like a quantum-inspired correction or attention mechanism over radial distances, introducing field-like twists without explicit EM fields.</reason>
