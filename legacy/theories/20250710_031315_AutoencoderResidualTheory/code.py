class AutoencoderResidualTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory drawing from deep learning autoencoders and Einstein's unified field pursuits, treating the metric as a compression function with residual connections (higher-order terms) to encode electromagnetic-like effects geometrically. Key modifications include cubic residual terms in g_tt and g_rr for information compression, a scaling in g_φφ inspired by extra dimensions, and a non-diagonal g_tφ for teleparallelism-like torsion encoding field effects. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^3), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^3 + beta * log(1 + r/rs)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + gamma * (rs/r)^2), g_tφ = delta * (rs / r) * torch.sin(rs / r)</summary>
