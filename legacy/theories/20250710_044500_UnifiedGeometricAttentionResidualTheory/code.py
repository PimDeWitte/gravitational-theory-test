class UnifiedGeometricAttentionResidualTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory pursuits with non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-residual decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via geometric attention-weighted torsional residuals, non-diagonal terms, and multi-scale unfoldings. Key features include attention-modulated sigmoid residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric effects, tanh and logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by teleparallelism, exponential attention in g_φφ for extra-dimensional compaction, and cosine-modulated tanh in g_tφ for torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**4 * torch.sigmoid(beta * torch.exp(-gamma * (rs/r)**3))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.tanh(epsilon * (rs/r)**2) + zeta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**4)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + eta * torch.exp(-theta * (rs/r)**2) * torch.sigmoid(iota * rs/r)), g_tφ = kappa * (rs / r) * torch.cos(3 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(2 * rs / r)</summary>
