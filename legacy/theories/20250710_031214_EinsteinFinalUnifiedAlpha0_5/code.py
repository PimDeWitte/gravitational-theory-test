    <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's final attempts to geometrize electromagnetism, introducing a parameterized repulsive term in the metric akin to electromagnetic effects, reducing to GR at alpha=0. The repulsion is encoded geometrically via higher-order rs/r terms, viewed as residual corrections in a deep learning-inspired compression of quantum information into classical geometry. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs / r)^2), g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs / r)^2), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = 0, with alpha=0.5.</summary>

        <reason>Inspired by Einstein's pursuit of unifying gravity and electromagnetism through geometry, similar to how Kaluza-Klein embeds EM in higher dimensions. Here, the metric is modified with a repulsive term alpha * (rs / r)^2 to mimic the electromagnetic repulsion in Reissner-Nordström without explicit charge, treating it as a geometric emergent effect. From a DL perspective, this acts as a residual connection adding higher-order (1/r^2) corrections to encode quantum-like information into the classical metric, improving 'compression' for charged scenarios.</reason>
