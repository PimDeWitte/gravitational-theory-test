class EinsteinKaluzaNonSymmetricResidualTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric unified field theory, Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, teleparallelism, and deep learning residual networks, treating the metric as a residual autoencoder compressing high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via non-symmetric residuals, torsion-inspired non-diagonal terms, and attention-like scalings. Key features include tanh-modulated exponential residuals in g_tt for saturated field compaction, sigmoid and logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric decoding, attention-weighted polynomial in g_φφ for extra-dimensional unfolding, and cosine-sine modulated g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**2 * torch.tanh(beta * (rs/r)) * torch.exp(-gamma * rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.sigmoid(epsilon * (rs/r)**3) + zeta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + eta * (rs/r) * torch.tanh(theta * rs/r) + iota * (rs/r)**3), g_tφ = kappa * (rs / r) * torch.cos(2 * rs / r) * torch.sin(rs / r)</summary>
