class ResidualAffineKaluzaDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's affine unified field theory for geometrizing fields without curvature, Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions for unifying gravity and electromagnetism, and deep learning residual decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information through residual connections for multi-scale fidelity, affine-inspired logarithmic terms for non-Riemannian encoding, and compactification-like sigmoid expansions for geometric unification without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * ((rs/r)^2 + torch.sigmoid((rs/r)^3) * (rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^4)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.tanh((rs/r)^2)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * (1 + torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r), torch.exp(-rs / r)]), dim=0)[1])</summary>
