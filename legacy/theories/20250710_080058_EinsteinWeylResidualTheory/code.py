class EinsteinWeylResidualTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's exploration of Weyl's gauge-invariant unified field theory and deep learning residual networks, modeling gravity as a scale-invariant geometric structure with residual connections that add higher-order corrections for encoding electromagnetic-like gauge fields. The metric includes residual logarithmic terms for Weyl-like conformal scale transformations, quadratic residuals for EM-mimicking fields, exponential decay for asymptotic regularization, tanh for bounded residuals, and a non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 * (1 + torch.log(1 + rs/r)) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r).</summary>
