class EinsteinUnifiedSqrtAlpha0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's final attempts to geometrize electromagnetism, introducing a parameterized square-root correction to encode repulsive effects akin to electromagnetic charges. This is viewed as a non-linear transformation in the deep learning-inspired compression of high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, with the sqrt term acting like a fractional-order residual connection over radial scales. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * sqrt(rs / r)), g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs/r + alpha * sqrt(rs / r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = 0, with alpha=0.5.</summary>

        # <reason>The alpha * sqrt(rs / r) term introduces a geometric correction inspired by Einstein's unified field efforts, mimicking electromagnetic repulsion through a non-linear, square-root dependence that grows stronger at smaller radii, analogous to a fractional-power residual in a deep learning autoencoder for multi-scale information compression.</reason>

        # <reason>g_tt is modified to include the repulsive correction, reducing to Schwarzschild at alpha=0, and encoding unified field effects as an additive term in the temporal metric component, like enhancing the decoder's fidelity for charged scenarios.</reason>
