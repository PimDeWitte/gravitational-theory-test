class EinsteinDLInspiredELU0_6(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>EinsteinDLInspiredELU0_6: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and teleparallelism, viewing spacetime as a deep learning autoencoder compressing high-dimensional quantum information. Introduces an ELU-activated repulsive term delta*(rs/r)^2 * elu(rs/r) with delta=0.6 to emulate electromagnetic effects via non-linear, smooth scale-dependent encoding (ELU as a DL activation function providing exponential growth for negative values, acting as a residual connection for handling compressed information below certain scales, inspired by quantum fluctuations). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = delta*(rs/r) * (1 - elu(rs/r)/(elu(rs/r) + 1)) for torsion-like interactions mimicking vector potentials, enabling geometric unification. Reduces to GR at delta=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + delta*(rs/r)^2 * elu(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta*(rs/r)^2 * elu(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = delta*(rs/r) * (1 - elu(rs/r)/(elu(rs/r) + 1)), where elu(x) = x if x >= 0 else (torch.exp(x) - 1).</summary>
