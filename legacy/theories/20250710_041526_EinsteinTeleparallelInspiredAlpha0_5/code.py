# <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's pursuit of geometrizing electromagnetism via teleparallelism, introducing a parameterized torsion-like off-diagonal term and a quadratic correction in the metric to mimic electromagnetic repulsion geometrically. This is viewed as a deep learning-inspired architecture where the off-diagonal acts as an attention mechanism between time and angular coordinates, compressing high-dimensional information, and the quadratic term as a residual layer for multi-scale encoding. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs / r)^2), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r)^2 * r, with alpha=0.5.</summary>
