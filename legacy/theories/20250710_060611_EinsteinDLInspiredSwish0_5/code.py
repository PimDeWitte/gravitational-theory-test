class EinsteinDLInspiredSwish0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>EinsteinDLInspiredSwish0_5: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and teleparallelism, viewing spacetime as a deep learning autoencoder compressing high-dimensional quantum information. Introduces a swish-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r)^2 * swish(rs/r) with alpha=0.5 to emulate electromagnetic effects via self-gated, non-linear scale-dependent encoding (swish as a DL activation function acting like a residual gate for adaptive information compression across scales). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * (1 - torch.sigmoid(rs/r)) for torsion-like interactions mimicking vector potentials, enabling geometric unification. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * swish(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * swish(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * (1 - torch.sigmoid(rs/r)), where swish(x) = x * torch.sigmoid(x).</summary>
