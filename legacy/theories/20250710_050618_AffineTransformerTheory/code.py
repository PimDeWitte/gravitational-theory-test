    """
    <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's affine unified field theory and deep learning transformer architectures, modeling gravity as an affine connection with transformer-like self-attention mechanisms over radial scales for encoding high-dimensional quantum information into geometric spacetime. The metric includes sinusoidal positional encodings for affine corrections mimicking electromagnetic fields, exponential terms for attention weighting, logarithmic regularization for multi-scale compression, and a non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2) * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.cos(rs/r) * (rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.cos(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r).</summary>
