# <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's pursuit and Kaluza-Klein theory, introducing parameterized logarithmic corrections in the off-diagonal g_tφ and a logarithmic dilation in g_φφ to encode electromagnetic-like effects via warped extra dimensions. This is viewed as a deep learning-inspired architecture where the log terms act as multi-scale attention mechanisms in the autoencoder-like compression of high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime, emphasizing logarithmic radial dependencies for asymptotic fidelity. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * log(1 + rs / r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * log(1 + rs / r) * r, with alpha=0.5.</summary>
