class EinsteinUnifiedGeometricTeleparallelKaluzaNonSymmetricAttentionResidualTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric attention-residual decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.02 * (rs/r)**5 * torch.tanh(0.1 * torch.sigmoid(0.3 * torch.exp(-0.4 * (rs/r)**3)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.05 * torch.exp(-0.15 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**4)) + 0.25 * torch.tanh(0.35 * (rs/r)**2)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.45 * (rs/r)**3 * torch.exp(-0.55 * (rs/r)**2) * torch.sigmoid(0.65 * rs/r)), g_tφ = 0.75 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(5 * rs / r) * torch.cos(3 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(0.85 * (rs/r)**2)</summary>
