class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricGeometricResidualMultiAttentionQuantumTorsionFidelityAutoencoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and multi-attention autoencoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-multi-attention autoencoder that compresses and decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric multi-attention-weighted unfoldings, quantum-inspired information fidelity terms, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include autoencoder-like multi-attention modulated residuals in g_tt for encoding/decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional and quantum effects, sigmoid and multi-scale exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted polynomial and logarithmic terms in g_φφ for compaction and quantum unfolding, and sine-cosine modulated sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric potentials with fidelity. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**9 * torch.tanh(beta * torch.sigmoid(gamma * torch.exp(-delta * (rs/r)**7))) + epsilon * (rs/r)**5 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**3)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + eta * torch.sigmoid(theta * torch.exp(-iota * torch.log1p((rs/r)**6))) + kappa * (rs/r)**8 + lambda_param * torch.tanh(mu * (rs/r)**4)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + nu * (rs/r)**7 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**5) * torch.sigmoid(xi * (rs/r)**4) + omicron * (rs/r)**2 * torch.exp(-pi * (rs/r)**3)), g_tφ = rho * (rs / r) * torch.sin(sigma * rs / r) * torch.cos(tau * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(upsilon * (rs/r)**5).</summary>
