# <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein approach to unification via extra dimensions and deep learning autoencoders, where spacetime geometry compresses high-dimensional information through residual logarithmic terms in g_tt mimicking multi-scale attention for quantum decoding, a modified g_φφ to encode compactification-like effects, and a non-diagonal g_tφ for geometric electromagnetism without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^2)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * (rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * torch.sin(r / rs)</summary>
