class NonSymmetricTeleparallelDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric unified field theory for geometrizing electromagnetism, teleparallelism for gravity via torsion, and deep learning decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information into classical geometry through non-symmetric inverse operations, torsion-inspired residuals, and compactification-like terms for multi-scale fidelity. It introduces a decoder-like inverse sigmoid term in g_tt for decompressing non-symmetric information, a teleparallel-inspired exponential correction in g_rr mimicking torsional effects, a modified g_φφ with higher-order logarithmic decoding expansion, and a non-diagonal g_tφ with residual-modulated non-symmetric oscillation for geometric encoding of electromagnetic effects without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^3 / (1 + torch.exp(- (rs/r)^2))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(- (rs/r))), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^3)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * (1 + torch.cos(rs / r))</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric theory where the metric encodes electromagnetic fields geometrically, and decoder architectures that decompress information using inverse operations; this term adds a residual higher-order correction divided by an inverse sigmoid-like function to mimic decoding compressed quantum states into classical gravity, with (rs/r)^3 as a non-symmetric inspired power for multi-scale effects.</reason>

        # <reason>Inspired by Kaluza-Klein compactification within a decoder framework, this logarithmic expansion in g_φφ decompresses extra-dimensional information into angular components, with higher-order (rs/r)^3 for multi-scale fidelity in encoding quantum to classical transition.</reason>
