class EinsteinUnifiedMultiResidual1_0(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory drawing from Einstein's unified field pursuits and Kaluza-Klein ideas, introducing a parameterized geometric correction with alpha=1.0 that mimics electromagnetic repulsion via multi-level residual terms (quadratic and cubic) in the metric, akin to multi-layer residual networks in deep learning architectures for hierarchically encoding quantum information from higher dimensions into spacetime geometry. The key metric components are g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * ((rs/r)^2 + 0.5 * (rs/r)^3)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * ((rs/r)^2 + 0.5 * (rs/r)^3)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * (rs/r)^2), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.sin(torch.pi * r / rs), reducing to GR at alpha=0 but adding EM-like effects for alpha>0.</summary>
