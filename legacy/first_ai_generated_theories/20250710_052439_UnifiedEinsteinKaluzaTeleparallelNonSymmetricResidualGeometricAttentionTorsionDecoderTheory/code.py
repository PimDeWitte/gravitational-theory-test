class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricResidualGeometricAttentionTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a geometric residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention sigmoid in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, tanh and exponential logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted sigmoid logarithmic and exponential terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.01 * (rs/r)**6 * torch.sigmoid(0.1 * torch.exp(-0.2 * (rs/r)**4))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.3 * torch.tanh(0.4 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**3)) + 0.5 * torch.exp(-0.6 * (rs/r)**5)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.7 * (rs/r)**5 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2) * torch.exp(-0.8 * (rs/r)**3) * torch.sigmoid(0.9 * (rs/r))), g_tφ = 1.0 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(6 * rs / r) * torch.cos(4 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(1.1 * (rs/r)**2).</summary>

        # <reason>Drawing from Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, the sigmoid-activated exponential term acts as an attention mechanism over radial scales, compressing high-dimensional information into the temporal component, mimicking electromagnetic field encoding without explicit charge through higher-order geometric corrections inspired by Einstein's unification efforts.</reason>
