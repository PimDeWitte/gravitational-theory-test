class EinsteinVAETheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's variational approaches to unified fields and deep learning variational autoencoders (VAEs), where the metric variationally encodes high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional geometric spacetime. Probabilistic encoding is modeled via Gaussian exponential terms for latent variable sampling, logarithmic terms for KL-divergence-like regularization, and a non-diagonal component for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2) * (rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * (rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r).</summary>
