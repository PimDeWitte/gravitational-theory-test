# <summary>EinsteinKKDLGaussian0_5: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning architectures with Gaussian radial basis functions, conceptualizing spacetime as an autoencoder compressing high-dimensional quantum information. Introduces a Gaussian-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r)^2 * exp(-(rs/r)^2) with alpha=0.5 to emulate electromagnetic effects via localized, scale-dependent geometric encoding (Gaussian as a kernel for attention-like mechanisms focusing information at specific radial scales, acting as a residual correction to GR). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * (1 - exp(-(rs/r)^2)) for torsion-like interactions inspired by teleparallelism, enabling geometric unification of vector potentials. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * exp(-(rs/r)^2)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * exp(-(rs/r)^2)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r) * (1 - exp(-(rs/r)^2)).</summary>
