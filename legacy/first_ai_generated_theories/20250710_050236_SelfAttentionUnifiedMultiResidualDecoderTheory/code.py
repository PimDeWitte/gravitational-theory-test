class SelfAttentionUnifiedMultiResidualDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theories including Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions for unifying gravity and electromagnetism, teleparallelism via torsion, non-symmetric metrics, and affine connections for geometrizing fields, combined with deep learning self-attention and multi-residual decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information through self-attention mechanisms for scale-selective fidelity across multiple residual paths, incorporating compactification-inspired sigmoid operations, torsional logarithmic terms, non-symmetric oscillatory corrections, and affine-inspired expansions for comprehensive geometric unification without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (self_att + residual1 + residual2)), where self_att = torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.stack([(rs/r), (rs/r)**2, (rs/r)**3], dim=-1), dim=-1) * torch.stack([(rs/r), (rs/r)**2, (rs/r)**3], dim=-1), dim=-1), residual1 = (rs/r)**4 / (1 + torch.sigmoid((rs/r)**2)), residual2 = torch.tanh((rs/r)**5) * (rs/r); g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)**4) * torch.tanh((rs/r))); g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)**3) * torch.exp(- (rs/r))); g_tφ = alpha * (rs**2 / r**2) * (1 + torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.stack([torch.sin(rs / r), torch.cos(rs / r), torch.exp(-r / rs)], dim=-1), dim=-1) * torch.stack([torch.sin(rs / r), torch.cos(rs / r), torch.exp(-r / rs)], dim=-1), dim=-1))</summary>
