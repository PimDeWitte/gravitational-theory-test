    """
    <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning autoencoders, modeling gravity as a geometric autoencoder through compact extra dimensions that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional spacetime. The metric includes tanh activations for bounded encoding, sinusoidal terms for periodic extra-dimensional compactification mimicking electromagnetic fields, logarithmic terms for multi-scale compression, exponential decay for latent regularization, and a non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2) * torch.cos(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r).</summary>
