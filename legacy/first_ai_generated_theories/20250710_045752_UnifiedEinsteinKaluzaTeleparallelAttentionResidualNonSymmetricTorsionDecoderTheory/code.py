class UnifiedEinsteinKaluzaTeleparallelAttentionResidualNonSymmetricTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-residual decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified torsional attention-weighted residuals, non-symmetric geometric unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated sigmoid and tanh residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, exponential and logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, sigmoid-weighted polynomial and exponential term in g_φφ for compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**4 * torch.sigmoid(beta * torch.tanh(gamma * torch.exp(-delta * (rs/r)**3)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + epsilon * torch.exp(-zeta * (rs/r)**2) + eta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**5) + theta * torch.sigmoid(iota * (rs/r))), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + kappa * (rs/r)**3 * torch.exp(-lambda_param * rs/r) * torch.sigmoid(mu * (rs/r)**2)), g_tφ = nu * (rs / r) * torch.sin(5 * rs / r) * torch.cos(3 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(xi * (rs/r))</summary>
