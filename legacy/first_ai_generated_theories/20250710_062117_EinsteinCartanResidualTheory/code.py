class EinsteinCartanResidualTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein-Cartan theory incorporating torsion and deep learning residual networks, modeling gravity as a torsional geometric structure with residual connections that add higher-order corrections for encoding high-dimensional quantum information and electromagnetic-like fields. The metric includes residual sinusoidal and logarithmic terms for torsional multi-scale compression mimicking Cartan torsion effects, exponential decay for residual regularization, tanh for bounded corrections, and a non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2 * (1 + torch.sin(rs/r) + torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^3 * torch.tanh(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r).</summary>
