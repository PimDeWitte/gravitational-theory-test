    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's affine unified field theory for geometrizing fields without curvature, teleparallelism for gravity via torsion, and deep learning attention decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information using attention mechanisms for selective multi-scale decoding, affine connections for geometric unification, and torsional residuals for fidelity in encoding electromagnetism geometrically. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^3, (rs/r)^4]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^3, (rs/r)^4]))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^3)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)^2)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * torch.tanh(torch.sin(rs / r))</summary>
