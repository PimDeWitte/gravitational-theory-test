class EinsteinUnifiedKaluzaNonSymmetricTeleparallelResidualAttentionTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning residual and attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as a residual-attention decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified non-symmetric teleparallel torsional residuals, attention-weighted geometric unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include residual-modulated attention sigmoid in g_tt for decoding field saturation with torsional non-symmetric effects, tanh and logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, attention-weighted exponential logarithmic term in g_φφ for compaction and unfolding, and cosine-modulated tanh sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**4 * torch.sigmoid(beta * torch.tanh(gamma * torch.exp(-delta * (rs/r)**3)))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + epsilon * torch.tanh(zeta * (rs/r)**2) + eta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**5)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + theta * torch.exp(-iota * (rs/r)**3) * torch.log1p((rs/r)) * torch.sigmoid(kappa * rs/r)), g_tφ = lambda_param * (rs / r) * torch.cos(5 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(3 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(mu * (rs/r)**2)</summary>
