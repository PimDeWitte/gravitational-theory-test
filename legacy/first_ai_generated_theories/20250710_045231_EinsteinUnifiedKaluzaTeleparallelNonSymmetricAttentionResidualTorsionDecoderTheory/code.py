class EinsteinUnifiedKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricAttentionResidualTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-residual decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified teleparallel torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted geometric unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated sigmoid exponential residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, tanh and logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, sigmoid-weighted polynomial logarithmic term in g_φφ for compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated tanh sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**4 * torch.sigmoid(beta * torch.exp(-gamma * (rs/r)**3))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.tanh(epsilon * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2)) + zeta * (rs/r)**5), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + eta * (rs/r)**3 * torch.log1p((rs/r)) * torch.sigmoid(theta * rs/r)), g_tφ = iota * (rs / r) * torch.sin(5 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(3 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(kappa * (rs/r)**2)</summary>
