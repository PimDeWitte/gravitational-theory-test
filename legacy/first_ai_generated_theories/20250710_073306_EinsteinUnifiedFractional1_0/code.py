# <summary>A theory drawing from Einstein's unified field pursuits and Kaluza-Klein ideas, introducing a parameterized geometric correction with alpha=1.0 that mimics electromagnetic repulsion via a fractional power (3/2) term in the metric, akin to fractional diffusion processes in deep learning architectures for encoding long-range quantum correlations into spacetime geometry. The key metric components are g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**1.5), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**1.5), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + alpha * (rs/r)**0.5), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.cos(torch.pi * (r / rs)**0.5), reducing to GR at alpha=0 but adding EM-like effects for alpha>0.</summary>
