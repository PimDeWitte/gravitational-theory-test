class MultiHeadAttentionTeleparallelNonSymmetricAffineResidualDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism for gravity via torsion, non-symmetric unified field theory for geometrizing electromagnetism, and affine unified field theory for geometrizing fields without curvature, combined with deep learning multi-head attention and residual decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information through multi-head attention mechanisms for diverse scale-selective fidelity, residual connections for multi-scale accuracy, torsional sigmoid operations for geometric gravity, non-symmetric oscillatory residuals, and affine-inspired logarithmic terms for unifying fields geometrically without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (head1 + head2 + residual)), where head1 = torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r), (rs/r)^3, (rs/r)^5]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r), (rs/r)^3, (rs/r)^5])), head2 = torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^4, (rs/r)^6]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^4, (rs/r)^6])) / (1 + torch.sigmoid((rs/r)^3)), residual = (rs/r)^4 / (1 + torch.tanh((rs/r)^2)); g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^5) * torch.tanh((rs/r))); g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)^4) * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^2)); g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * (1 + torch.softmax(torch.tensor([torch.sin(rs / r), torch.cos(rs / r), torch.exp(-r / rs)]), dim=0)[1] + torch.tanh((rs/r)^3))</summary>
