class EinsteinKaluzaUnifiedNonSymmetricTeleparallelAttentionResidualTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-residual decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified non-symmetric teleparallel torsional residuals, attention-weighted geometric unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated sigmoid logarithmic residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with torsional effects, tanh and exponential residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, sigmoid-weighted exponential polynomial in g_φφ for compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log1p((rs/r)**3) * torch.sigmoid(beta * (rs/r)**2)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + gamma * torch.tanh(delta * torch.exp(-epsilon * (rs/r)**4)) + zeta * (rs/r)**5), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + eta * (rs/r)**2 * torch.exp(-theta * rs/r) * torch.sigmoid(iota * (rs/r))), g_tφ = kappa * (rs / r) * torch.sin(4 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(lambda_param * (rs/r)**3)</summary>
