class EinsteinUnifiedAlpha0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory drawing from Einstein's unified field pursuits and Kaluza-Klein ideas, introducing a parameterized geometric correction with alpha=0.5 that mimics electromagnetic repulsion via a higher-order term in the metric, akin to a residual connection in deep learning architectures for encoding additional information. The key metric components are g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^2), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.sin(r / rs), reducing to GR at alpha=0 but adding EM-like effects for alpha>0.</summary>

        # <reason>Standard Schwarzschild radius from GR, serving as the base for geometric description of mass in curved spacetime, inspired by Einstein's geometric approach to gravity.</reason>
        alpha = 0.5
        # <reason>Parameter alpha=0.5 controls the strength of the geometric unification correction, drawing from Einstein's parameterized attempts in unified field theories and analogous to hyperparameters in deep learning models for tuning information encoding.</reason>
        correction = alpha * (rs / r) ** 2
        # <reason>Quadratic correction term geometrically mimics the repulsive Q^2/r^2 contribution in the Reissner-Nordström metric for charged sources, inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions where electromagnetism emerges from geometry; conceptually akin to a residual connection in an autoencoder compressing high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime.</reason>
        A = 1 - rs / r + correction
        # <reason>A combines the GR term with the unified correction, representing a modified gravitational potential that encodes both gravitational and electromagnetic-like effects in a purely geometric way, reflecting Einstein's pursuit of unification through geometry.</reason>
        g_tt = -A
        # <reason>Time-time component provides the temporal metric structure, with the correction reducing gravitational attraction to emulate electromagnetic repulsion, inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metric ideas for incorporating fields.</reason>
        g_rr = 1 / A
        # <reason>Radial component ensures metric invertibility and consistency with light-like geodesics, modified inversely to maintain the unified potential's influence on radial motion.</reason>
        g_phiphi = r ** 2
        # <reason>Angular component remains standard spherical, unchanged to preserve asymptotic flatness and focus unification effects on radial/temporal geometry, akin to how extra dimensions in Kaluza-Klein affect primarily the potential terms.</reason>
        g_tphi = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.sin(r / rs)
        # <reason>Off-diagonal time-angular term introduces a non-symmetric element mimicking the electromagnetic vector potential from Kaluza-Klein compactification or teleparallel torsion; the sinusoidal dependence adds a scale-dependent fluctuation, inspired by quantum corrections and attention mechanisms in DL over radial scales for informational fidelity.</reason>
