    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning normalizing flows, modeling gravity as an invertible flow through compact extra dimensions that maps high-dimensional quantum distributions to low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric includes tanh for invertible flow activations, exp for density transformations, sin for periodic extra-dimensional compactification, log for multi-scale entropy regularization, and a non-diagonal term for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * (rs/r) / (1 + torch.sin(rs/r))), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r).</summary>
