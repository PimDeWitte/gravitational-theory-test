class NonSymmetricDiffusionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metric approach and deep learning diffusion models, modeling gravity as a non-symmetric diffusive process that denoises high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric includes exponential diffusion kernels for noise scheduling, tanh for bounded asymmetric corrections, sin for periodic field encodings, log for multi-scale entropy regularization, and a non-diagonal term for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2 / 2) * torch.tanh(rs/r) * (1 + torch.sin(rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r))), g_tφ = alpha * (rs**2 / r**2) * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r).</summary>
