class KaluzaTeleparallelResidualTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, Einstein's teleparallelism, and deep learning residual networks, treating the metric as a residual-based autoencoder that compresses and decodes high-dimensional quantum information into classical geometric spacetime, encoding electromagnetism via torsion-inspired non-diagonal terms and attention-like residual corrections. Key features include cubic and quartic residuals in g_tt and g_rr for higher-order geometric encoding, a sigmoid-activated g_φφ for extra-dimensional attention scaling, and a modulated sine in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion mimicking vector potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**3 + beta * torch.exp(-gamma * (rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * (rs/r)**4 + epsilon * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + zeta * torch.sigmoid(eta * (rs/r))), g_tφ = theta * (rs / r) * torch.sin(2 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(rs / r)</summary>
