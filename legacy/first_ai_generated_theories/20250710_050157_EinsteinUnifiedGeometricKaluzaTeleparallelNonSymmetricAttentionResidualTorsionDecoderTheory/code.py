class EinsteinUnifiedGeometricKaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricAttentionResidualTorsionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention and residual decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-residual geometric decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified geometric torsional residuals, non-symmetric attention-weighted unfoldings, and modulated non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated sigmoid and exponential residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with non-symmetric torsional effects, tanh and logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, sigmoid-weighted exponential and polynomial terms in g_φφ for geometric compaction and unfolding, and sine-modulated cosine tanh in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + 0.05 * (rs/r)**6 * torch.sigmoid(0.15 * torch.exp(-0.25 * (rs/r)**4))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + 0.35 * torch.tanh(0.45 * torch.log1p((rs/r)**3)) + 0.55 * (rs/r)**5), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + 0.65 * (rs/r)**4 * torch.exp(-0.75 * (rs/r)**2) * torch.sigmoid(0.85 * (rs/r))), g_tφ = 0.95 * (rs / r) * torch.sin(6 * rs / r) * torch.cos(4 * rs / r) * torch.tanh(1.05 * (rs/r)**2)</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metrics and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, this g_tt includes a higher-power residual term modulated by sigmoid and exponential functions to mimic attention-based compression of electromagnetic fields into geometric curvature, akin to decoding quantum information with residual connections for field saturation effects without explicit charge.</reason>
