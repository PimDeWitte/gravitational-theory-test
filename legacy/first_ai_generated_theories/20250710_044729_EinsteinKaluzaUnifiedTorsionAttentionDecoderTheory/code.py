class EinsteinKaluzaUnifiedTorsionAttentionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-based decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via unified torsional attention-weighted residuals, geometric unfoldings, and non-diagonal terms. Key features include attention-modulated tanh residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation with torsional effects, sigmoid and logarithmic residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding inspired by extra dimensions, exponential attention-weighted polynomial in g_φφ for compaction and unfolding, and cosine-modulated sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**2 * torch.tanh(beta * torch.exp(-gamma * (rs/r)**3))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + delta * torch.sigmoid(epsilon * (rs/r)**4) + zeta * torch.log1p((rs/r)**2)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + eta * (rs/r)**3 * torch.exp(-theta * rs/r) * torch.sigmoid(iota * (rs/r))), g_tφ = kappa * (rs / r) * torch.cos(3 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(lambda_param * (rs/r)**2)</summary>
