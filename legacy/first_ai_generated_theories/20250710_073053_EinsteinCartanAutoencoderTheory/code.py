class EinsteinCartanAutoencoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein-Cartan theory with torsion and deep learning autoencoders, modeling gravity as a torsional geometric autoencoder that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional spacetime via torsion-encoded mappings. The metric includes tanh activations for bounded torsional encoding, sinusoidal terms for periodic spin-torsion couplings mimicking electromagnetic fields, logarithmic terms for multi-scale information compression, exponential decay for latent space regularization, and a non-diagonal term for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.cos(rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.cos(rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r).</summary>
