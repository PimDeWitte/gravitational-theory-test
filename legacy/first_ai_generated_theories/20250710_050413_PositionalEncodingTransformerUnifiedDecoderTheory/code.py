    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theories including Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, teleparallelism via torsion, non-symmetric metrics, and affine connections for geometrizing gravity and electromagnetism, combined with deep learning transformer architectures featuring positional encoding, multi-head self-attention, and residual decoder layers, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information through positional encoding for radial scale awareness, multi-head self-attention for capturing long-range dependencies and selective fidelity, residual connections for multi-scale accuracy, compactification-inspired sigmoid operations, torsional logarithmic terms, non-symmetric oscillatory residuals, and affine-inspired expansions for comprehensive geometric unification without explicit charges.
