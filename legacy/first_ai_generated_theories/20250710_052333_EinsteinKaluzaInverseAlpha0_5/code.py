# <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's pursuit and Kaluza-Klein theory, introducing parameterized inverse corrections in g_tt and g_rr, and an off-diagonal g_tφ with inverse radial dependence to encode electromagnetic-like effects via warped extra dimensions. This is viewed as a deep learning-inspired architecture where the inverse terms act as normalizing flows in the autoencoder-like compression of high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime, providing multi-scale decoding with attention to asymptotic behaviors. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha / (1 + r/rs)), g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs/r + alpha / (1 + r/rs)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) / (1 + rs/r) * r, with alpha=0.5.</summary>
