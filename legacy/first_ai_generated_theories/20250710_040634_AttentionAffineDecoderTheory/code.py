class AttentionAffineDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's affine unified field theory for geometrizing fields without curvature and deep learning attention decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information using attention mechanisms for selective scale decoding and affine connections for geometric unification of gravity and electromagnetism. It introduces an attention-weighted residual sum in g_tt for multi-scale information decompression, an affine-inspired logarithmic correction in g_rr mimicking non-Riemannian connections, a modified g_φφ with softmax-based expansion for decoding compactified dimensions, and a non-diagonal g_tφ with hyperbolic modulated decay for geometric encoding of electromagnetic-like effects without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r), (rs/r)^3]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r), (rs/r)^3]))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^2)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r)^2, (rs/r)^4]), dim=0)[1] * (rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * torch.tanh(torch.exp(- (r / rs)))</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by deep learning attention decoders and Einstein's affine theory, this term uses a softmax-weighted sum over radial powers to selectively decompress multi-scale quantum information into gravitational potential, mimicking affine connections that unify fields geometrically through scale-aware residuals.</reason>

        # <reason>Drawing from affine unified field theory's non-Riemannian geometry and decoder inversion, the logarithmic correction acts as an invertible decompression of torsional or extra-dimensional effects, ensuring fidelity in decoding high-dimensional states to classical radial geometry.</reason>

        # <reason>Inspired by Kaluza-Klein compactification within an affine framework and attention mechanisms, this softmax-selected expansion decodes angular information from higher dimensions, providing a geometric compression of quantum angular momentum into classical spacetime structure.</reason>

        # <reason>Motivated by Einstein's non-symmetric metrics for electromagnetism and decoder architectures, this non-diagonal term with hyperbolic tangent modulation of exponential decay geometrically encodes field-like effects, decompressing time-angular couplings as if from hidden quantum dimensions without explicit charges.</reason>
