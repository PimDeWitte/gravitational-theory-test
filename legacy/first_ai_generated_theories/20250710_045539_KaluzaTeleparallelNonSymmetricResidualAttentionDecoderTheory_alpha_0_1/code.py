class KaluzaTeleparallelNonSymmetricResidualAttentionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions for unifying gravity and electromagnetism, teleparallelism for gravity via torsion, and non-symmetric unified field theory for geometrizing electromagnetism, combined with deep learning residual attention decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information through residual attention mechanisms for multi-scale selective fidelity, compactification-inspired logarithmic terms for extra-dimensional encoding, torsional sigmoid operations for geometric gravity, and non-symmetric residuals for unifying fields geometrically without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * ((rs/r)^3 / (1 + torch.tanh((rs/r)^2)) + torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r)^4, (rs/r)^6]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r)^4, (rs/r)^6])) )), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^5) * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)^3)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.exp(- (rs/r)^4)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * (1 + torch.softmax(torch.tensor([torch.sin(rs / r), torch.cos(rs / r)]), dim=0)[0])</summary>
