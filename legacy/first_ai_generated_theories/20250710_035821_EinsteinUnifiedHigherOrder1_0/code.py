class EinsteinUnifiedHigherOrder1_0(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory drawing from Einstein's unified field pursuits and Kaluza-Klein ideas, introducing a parameterized geometric correction with alpha=1.0 that mimics electromagnetic repulsion via a higher-order (cubic) term in the metric, akin to a deeper residual connection in deep learning architectures for encoding additional quantum information. The key metric components are g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^3), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^3), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r)^2 * torch.sin(r / rs), reducing to GR at alpha=0 but adding EM-like effects for alpha>0.</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by Einstein's attempts with higher-order geometry and DL residual layers, the cubic term provides a stronger repulsion at small scales, simulating encoded EM from quantum dimensions.</reason>
        g_tt = -(1 - rs / r + alpha * (rs / r)**3)

        # <reason>Modified similarly to g_tt to preserve the metric structure, as in RN metric for consistency in decoding the geometry.</reason>
        g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs / r + alpha * (rs / r)**3)

        # <reason>Standard r^2, keeping angular part unchanged to focus modifications on radial and temporal, akin to isotropic coordinates in unified theories.</reason>
        g_phiphi = r**2

        # <reason>The off-diagonal term introduces a geometric "twist" inspired by teleparallelism and KK extra dimensions, with sinusoidal modulation to represent wave-like quantum information compression over radial scales, like attention mechanism.</reason>
