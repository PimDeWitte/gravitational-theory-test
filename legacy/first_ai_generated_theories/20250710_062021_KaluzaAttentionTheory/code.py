class KaluzaAttentionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention mechanisms, modeling gravity as an attentional focusing through compact extra dimensions that compresses high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric incorporates exponential attention weights for radial scale selection mimicking dimensional compactification, sinusoidal terms for periodic extra-dimensional effects emulating electromagnetic fields, logarithmic terms for multi-scale quantum information encoding, tanh for bounded attention corrections, and a non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.cos(rs/r) * (rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2) * torch.sin(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r).</summary>
