class EinsteinUnifiedExpCorrection1_0(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory drawing from Einstein's unified field pursuits and Kaluza-Klein ideas, introducing a parameterized geometric correction with alpha=1.0 that mimics electromagnetic repulsion via an exponential decay term in the metric, akin to attention mechanisms with exponential decay in deep learning architectures for encoding quantum information with radial falloff. The key metric components are g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-rs / r) * (rs/r)^2), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-rs / r) * (rs/r)^2), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.exp(-rs / r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.sin(torch.exp(-r / rs)), reducing to GR at alpha=0 but adding EM-like effects for alpha>0.</summary>
