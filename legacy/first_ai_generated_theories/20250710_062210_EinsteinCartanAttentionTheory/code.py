class EinsteinCartanAttentionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein-Cartan theory with torsion and deep learning attention mechanisms, modeling gravity as a torsional attentional process that focuses and compresses high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional geometric spacetime via attention over radial scales. The metric incorporates exponential attention weights for torsional scale focusing mimicking Cartan torsion effects, sinusoidal terms for periodic spin-torsion couplings emulating electromagnetic fields, logarithmic terms for multi-scale quantum information encoding, tanh for bounded attention corrections, and a non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.cos(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2) * (rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.exp(-rs/r) * torch.cos(rs/r).</summary>
