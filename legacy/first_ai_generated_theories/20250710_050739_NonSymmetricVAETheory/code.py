    <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric metric approach and deep learning variational autoencoders (VAEs), modeling gravity as a non-symmetric variational encoding of high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric includes Gaussian exponential terms for probabilistic latent sampling, tanh for bounded asymmetric corrections, sinusoidal terms for periodic field encodings, logarithmic KL-like regularization, and a non-diagonal component for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2) * torch.tanh(rs/r) * (1 + torch.sin(rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.cos(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.exp(-rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r).</summary>
