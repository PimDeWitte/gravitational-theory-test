class TeleparallelFlowTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and deep learning normalizing flows, modeling gravity as a teleparallel connection with invertible flow transformations that map high-dimensional quantum distributions to low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric includes tanh for flow activations, exp for density scalings, log for entropy regularization, cos for periodic torsional effects, and a non-diagonal term for electromagnetic unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r) * (1 + torch.log(1 + rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.cos(rs/r) * (rs/r) / (1 + torch.exp(-rs/r))), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.cos(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2).</summary>
