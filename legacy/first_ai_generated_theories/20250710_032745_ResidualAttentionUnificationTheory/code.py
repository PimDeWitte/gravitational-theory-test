class ResidualAttentionUnificationTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and non-symmetric unified field theories, combined with deep learning residual and attention mechanisms, where spacetime geometry acts as a multi-scale encoder compressing quantum information. It introduces a residual attention-like term in g_tt using softmax over radial powers for scale-aware compression, a torsion-inspired correction in g_rr mimicking teleparallel gravity, and a non-diagonal g_tφ with exponential decay for geometric encoding of electromagnetic effects without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.softmax(torch.tensor([rs/r, (rs/r)^2]), dim=0)[0] * (rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^3), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * torch.exp(- (r / rs))</summary>

        # <reason>Inspired by Einstein's pursuit of unification through geometry and deep learning attention mechanisms; this term adds a residual correction to g_tt, using a softmax over radial scales (rs/r and (rs/r)^2) to weight contributions adaptively, mimicking attention-based compression of multi-scale quantum information into classical geometry, aiming to encode electromagnetic-like effects emergently.</reason>

        # <reason>Drawing from teleparallelism where gravity is described by torsion rather than curvature; this introduces a higher-order (rs/r)^3 term in g_rr as a geometric perturbation mimicking torsional effects, enhancing the encoding of high-dimensional information while preserving GR limits for small alpha.</reason>

        # <reason>Inspired by Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and non-symmetric metrics for unification; this non-diagonal term geometrically encodes field-like (electromagnetic) effects via an exponentially decaying function of r/rs, simulating compactification and attention decay over distances without explicit charges.</reason>
