class GeometricAttentionTeleparallelTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's teleparallelism and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, combined with deep learning attention mechanisms, viewing the metric as an attention-based decoder that reconstructs classical spacetime by compressing high-dimensional quantum information, encoding electromagnetism via torsion-like attention-weighted residuals and geometric unfoldings. Key features include attention-exponential residuals in g_tt and g_rr for decoding field compaction, a hyperbolic-scaled g_φφ for extra-dimensional attention, and a cosine-modulated g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**2 * torch.exp(-beta * (rs/r))), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)**2 * torch.exp(-beta * (rs/r)) + gamma * torch.tanh(rs/r)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + delta * torch.exp(-epsilon * (rs/r))), g_tφ = zeta * (rs / r) * torch.cos(2 * rs / r)</summary>
