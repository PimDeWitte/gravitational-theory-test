    <summary>EinsteinKKDLSoftsign0_6: A unified field theory variant inspired by Einstein's Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning autoencoders with softsign activation, conceptualizing spacetime as a compressor of high-dimensional quantum information into geometric structures. Introduces a softsign-activated repulsive term alpha*(rs/r)^2 * softsign(rs/r) with alpha=0.6 to emulate electromagnetic effects via non-linear, bounded scale-dependent encoding (softsign as a smooth activation function providing saturation like attention mechanisms for efficient information compression across radial scales, acting as a residual correction to GR). Adds off-diagonal g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * (1 - softsign(rs/r)) for torsion-like interactions inspired by teleparallelism, enabling geometric unification of vector potentials. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * softsign(rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha*(rs/r)^2 * softsign(rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha*(rs/r)^2 * (1 - softsign(rs/r)), where softsign(x) = x / (1 + torch.abs(x)).</summary>
