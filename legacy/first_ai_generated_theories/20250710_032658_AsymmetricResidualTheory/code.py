class AsymmetricResidualTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's non-symmetric unified field theory and Kaluza-Klein, introducing a non-diagonal g_tφ term to geometrically encode electromagnetic-like effects without explicit charge, and a residual higher-order term in g_tt mimicking deep learning residual connections for multi-scale information compression in spacetime geometry. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (rs/r)^3), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2)</summary>
