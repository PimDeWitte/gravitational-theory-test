class EinsteinUnifiedNonSymmetricAttentionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theory using non-symmetric metrics and teleparallelism, combined with Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions and deep learning attention decoder mechanisms, treating the metric as an attention-based decoder that decompresses high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, encoding electromagnetism via non-symmetric attention-weighted torsional residuals, geometric unfoldings, and non-diagonal terms. Key features include sigmoid-modulated logarithmic residuals in g_tt for decoding field saturation, tanh and exponential residuals in g_rr for multi-scale geometric encoding, attention-weighted exponential in g_φφ for extra-dimensional compaction, and cosine-modulated sigmoid in g_tφ for teleparallel torsion encoding asymmetric rotational potentials. Metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log1p((rs/r)**3) * torch.sigmoid(beta * (rs/r)**2)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + gamma * torch.tanh(delta * (rs/r)) + epsilon * torch.exp(-zeta * (rs/r)**4)), g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + eta * torch.exp(-theta * (rs/r)**2) * torch.sigmoid(iota * rs/r)), g_tφ = kappa * (rs / r) * torch.cos(3 * rs / r) * torch.sigmoid(lambda_param * (rs/r))</summary>
