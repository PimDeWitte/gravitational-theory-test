class MultiLayerFeedForwardTransformerUnifiedDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's unified field theories including Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, teleparallelism via torsion, non-symmetric metrics, and affine connections for geometrizing gravity and electromagnetism, combined with deep learning transformer architectures featuring multiple feed-forward layers, positional encoding, multi-head self-attention, and residual connections in a decoder structure, where spacetime acts as a multi-layer decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information with enhanced non-linear transformations for improved multi-scale fidelity, incorporating compactification-inspired sigmoid operations, torsional logarithmic terms, non-symmetric oscillatory residuals, and affine-inspired expansions for comprehensive geometric unification without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (layer1 + layer2)), where layer1 = pos_enc + self_att_head1 + ff_layer1 + residual1, layer2 = self_att_head2 + ff_layer2 + residual2, with detailed definitions below; g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)**6) * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)**3)); g_φφ = r**2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)**4) * torch.exp(- (rs/r)**2) * torch.sin((rs/r)**3)); g_tφ = alpha * (rs**2 / r**2) * (1 + torch.softmax(torch.stack([torch.sin(2 * rs / r), torch.cos(3 * rs / r), torch.tanh(4 * rs / r)], dim=-1), dim=-1)[1] + torch.cos((rs / r)**2))</summary>
