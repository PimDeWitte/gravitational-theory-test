class EinsteinCartanDiffusionTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein-Cartan theory with torsion and deep learning diffusion models, modeling gravity as a torsional diffusive process that denoises high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional geometric spacetime. The metric incorporates exponential diffusion kernels for torsional noise scheduling mimicking Cartan torsion effects, sinusoidal terms for periodic spin-torsion couplings emulating electromagnetic fields, tanh for bounded diffusive corrections, logarithmic terms for multi-scale entropy regularization, and a non-diagonal term for unification: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2 / 2) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r)), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.cos(rs/r) * torch.exp(-rs/r) * (rs/r)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.tanh(rs/r) * torch.sin(rs/r) * torch.exp(-(rs/r)^2)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs / r) * torch.log(1 + rs/r) * torch.cos(rs/r).</summary>
