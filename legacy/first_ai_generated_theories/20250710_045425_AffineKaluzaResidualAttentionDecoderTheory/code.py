class AffineKaluzaResidualAttentionDecoderTheory(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    <summary>A theory inspired by Einstein's affine unified field theory for geometrizing fields without curvature and Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions for unifying gravity and electromagnetism, combined with deep learning residual attention decoder architectures, where spacetime acts as a decoder decompressing high-dimensional quantum information through residual attention mechanisms for multi-scale selective fidelity, affine-inspired terms for non-Riemannian encoding, and compactification-like residuals for geometric unification without explicit charges. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * ( (rs/r)^2 + torch.sum(torch.softmax(torch.tensor([(rs/r)^3, (rs/r)^5]), dim=0) * torch.tensor([(rs/r)^3, (rs/r)^5])) )), g_rr = 1/(1 - rs/r + alpha * torch.log(1 + (rs/r)^4)), g_φφ = r^2 * (1 + alpha * torch.sigmoid((rs/r)^3)), g_tφ = alpha * (rs^2 / r^2) * (1 + torch.softmax(torch.tensor([torch.sin(rs / r), torch.exp(-r / rs)]), dim=0)[0])</summary>
