class EinsteinUnifiedSigmoidAlpha0_5(GravitationalTheory):
    # <summary>A unified field theory inspired by Einstein's final attempts to geometrize electromagnetism, introducing a parameterized sigmoid correction to encode repulsive effects akin to electromagnetic charges. This is viewed as a deep learning-inspired architecture where the sigmoid term acts as a non-linear activation function in the autoencoder-like compression of high-dimensional quantum information into classical spacetime geometry, providing smooth transitions over radial scales for adaptive encoding. Reduces to GR at alpha=0. Key metric: g_tt = -(1 - rs/r + alpha * (1 / (1 + exp(-(rs / r - 0.5))))), g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs/r + alpha * (1 / (1 + exp(-(rs / r - 0.5))))), g_φφ = r^2, g_tφ = 0, with alpha=0.5.</summary>

        alpha = torch.tensor(0.5)
        rs = 2 * G_param * M_param / (C_param ** 2)
        # <reason>Compute the Schwarzschild radius rs as the base gravitational scale, inspired by GR's geometric encoding of mass; this serves as the foundational 'latent variable' in the autoencoder analogy for compressing quantum information into spacetime curvature.</reason>

        ratio = rs / r
        # <reason>Define ratio = rs / r as the normalized radial coordinate, acting like a feature input to the 'neural network' of the metric, enabling scale-invariant corrections akin to attention over radial distances in deep learning architectures.</reason>

        sigmoid_term = 1 / (1 + torch.exp(-(ratio - 0.5)))
        # <reason>Introduce a sigmoid function centered at rs/r=0.5 to provide a smooth, bounded repulsive correction, mimicking electromagnetic effects geometrically; this is inspired by Einstein's attempts to unify fields through metric modifications and viewed as a sigmoid activation in a DL autoencoder, facilitating non-linear compression and stable decoding of high-dimensional information with a transition zone for multi-scale fidelity.</reason>

        correction = alpha * sigmoid_term
        # <reason>Scale the sigmoid term by alpha to parameterize the strength of the geometric 'repulsion', reducing to pure GR at alpha=0; this acts as a learnable parameter in the DL-inspired framework, allowing sweeps to minimize decoding loss in orbital tests.</reason>

        g_tt = -(1 - ratio + correction)
        # <reason>Set g_tt with the GR term -(1 - rs/r) plus the positive correction to introduce repulsion, akin to the +rq^2/r^2 in Reissner-Nordström; this encodes EM-like effects purely geometrically, as per Einstein's unified field pursuit, and functions as the 'decoder' output in the information compression hypothesis.</reason>

        g_rr = 1 / (1 - ratio + correction)
        # <reason>Set g_rr as the inverse for consistency with the spherically symmetric metric form, ensuring the geometry remains a valid compression of quantum states; this maintains the autoencoder-like invertibility for 'decoding' classical orbits.</reason>

        g_phiphi = r ** 2
        # <reason>Keep g_φφ = r^2 as in standard GR to preserve angular geometry, focusing modifications on radial-temporal components for unified field effects without altering compact dimensions directly.</reason>

        g_tphi = torch.zeros_like(r)
        # <reason>Set g_tφ=0 to avoid off-diagonal terms, emphasizing pure metric modifications for repulsion in this Einstein Final-inspired variant, differing from non-symmetric or KK approaches.</reason>
