class EinsteinUnifiedGeometricField2(GravitationalTheory):
    """
    A candidate for Einstein's final theory, synthesizing his work on unification.

    This model attempts to unify gravity and electromagnetism through a purely
    geometric framework, inspired by three key principles from Einstein's later work:

    1.  **Asymmetric Metric**: The metric's time and space components are modified
        differently, a phenomenological approach to an asymmetric metric tensor
        ($g_{\mu\nu} \neq g_{\nu\mu}$), where the antisymmetric part was hoped to
        describe electromagnetism.

    2.  **Geometric Source for Electromagnetism**: The electromagnetic term is not
        added, but arises from a non-linear interaction between the gravitational
        potential ($r_s/r$) and the charge potential ($r_q^2/r^2$). This models the
        idea that the electromagnetic field is a feature of the gravitational field,
        not separate from it.

    3.  **Logarithmic Potential**: A logarithmic term is included, representing a
        subtle, long-range modification to the geometry. This can be interpreted as
        a nod to the need for a deeper theory underlying quantum mechanics, introducing
        a new informational layer or "hidden variable" into the geometry itself,
        consistent with Einstein's desire for a more complete, deterministic reality.

    <reason>This theory represents a culmination of the project's goals. It is a creative, physically motivated attempt to model the principles of unification that Einstein pursued. It combines his known theoretical approaches into a single, testable hypothesis. Its performance against the dual baselines will be the ultimate test of this information-theoretic framework.</reason>
